Steps to Maintain Position on the Same Record:
Store the Record Identifier:

Before closing the edit form, store the primary key (or unique identifier) of the record that was being edited.
Requery the Parent Form:

Requery the parent form to refresh the data.
Find the Record in the Parent Form:

After requerying, use the FindFirst method of the form’s recordset to navigate back to the record that matches the stored identifier.
Example Code:
Here’s how you can modify the Unload event of the edit form to requery the parent form and reposition it on the original record:

Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    Dim parentForm As Form
    Dim recordID As Variant

    ' Check if the parent form is open
    If CurrentProject.AllForms("ParentFormName").IsLoaded Then
        ' Get a reference to the parent form
        Set parentForm = Forms("ParentFormName")

        ' Store the ID of the current record
        recordID = Me!YourPrimaryKeyFieldName ' Replace with your primary key field name

        ' Requery the parent form
        parentForm.Requery

        ' Find the record that was being edited
        With parentForm.RecordsetClone
            .FindFirst "[YourPrimaryKeyFieldName] = " & recordID
            If Not .NoMatch Then
                ' If the record is found, move to that record in the form
                parentForm.Bookmark = .Bookmark
            End If
        End With
    End If
End Sub

Explanation:
Store the Record Identifier:

recordID = Me!YourPrimaryKeyFieldName: This line stores the primary key of the record being edited in a variable. Replace YourPrimaryKeyFieldName with the name of the primary key field.
Requery the Parent Form:

parentForm.Requery: Requeries the parent form to refresh its data.
Find the Original Record:

The FindFirst method searches for the record that matches the stored primary key in the form’s recordset.
parentForm.Bookmark = .Bookmark: If the record is found, the form’s Bookmark property is set to the bookmark of the found record, positioning the form on that record.
Notes:
Ensure that the primary key field is correctly referenced and that it uniquely identifies each record in the parent form's record source.

If your primary key is a string, make sure to handle the quotes correctly:
.FindFirst "[YourPrimaryKeyFieldName] = '" & recordID & "'"
The example assumes the primary key is a numeric field. Adjust the syntax as needed if it’s a string or another type.

This approach ensures that after the edit form is closed, the parent form is refreshed and positioned back on the original record, providing a seamless user experience.
