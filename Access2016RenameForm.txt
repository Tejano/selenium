To suppress the warning message that appears when replacing an existing form with a tempForm 
(when the existing form is closed), you can use the DoCmd.SetWarnings method in VBA. 
This method allows you to turn off system warnings temporarily while performing actions that typically trigger them.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code to suppress the warning message:

Example Code:

Sub RenameTempForm()
    Dim tempFormName As String
    Dim existingFormName As String
    Dim db As DAO.Database

    Set db = CurrentDb
    tempFormName = "TempFormName"       ' Replace with your temp form name
    existingFormName = "ExistingFormName" ' Replace with the existing form name

    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler

    ' Suppress warning messages
    DoCmd.SetWarnings False

    ' Try to rename the temp form to the existing form name
    DoCmd.Rename existingFormName, acForm, tempFormName

    MsgBox "Form renamed successfully!", vbInformation

    ' Re-enable warning messages
    DoCmd.SetWarnings True

    Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
    ' Re-enable warning messages in case of an error
    DoCmd.SetWarnings True

    ' If an error occurs, check if it's because the existing form is open
    If Err.Number = 2501 Then ' 2501 is the error number for "The OpenForm action was canceled"
        MsgBox "Cannot rename the form because the existing form is open. Deleting the temp form.", vbExclamation
        
        ' Delete the temp form
        DoCmd.DeleteObject acForm, tempFormName
    Else
        ' Handle other potential errors
        MsgBox "An unexpected error occurred: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
    End If

    ' Clear the error
    Err.Clear
End Sub

Explanation:
Suppressing Warnings:

DoCmd.SetWarnings False: This line turns off system warning messages, such as the one that appears when replacing an existing object in Access.
DoCmd.SetWarnings True: This line re-enables system warnings after the operation is complete.
Try to Rename the Temp Form:

While warnings are suppressed, the DoCmd.Rename operation is performed. If the existing form is closed, it will be replaced by the tempForm without showing any warning message.
Re-enable Warnings:

After the renaming operation (and within the error handler if needed), warnings are turned back on to ensure that other operations are not affected.
Important Notes:
Error Handling: Ensure that DoCmd.SetWarnings True is executed in the error handler as well, so that warnings are turned back on even if an error occurs during the renaming process.
Caution: Use DoCmd.SetWarnings False carefully because it suppresses all system warnings, not just the one for replacing forms.
Always re-enable warnings immediately after the specific operation to avoid suppressing other important warnings.
This approach will prevent the warning message from appearing when the existing form is closed and is replaced by the tempForm.
