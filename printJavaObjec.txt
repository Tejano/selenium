List<Object[]> commHist = repository.memETCommHist(202303);

for (Object[] objArray : commHist) {
    StringBuilder line = new StringBuilder();
    
    for (Object obj : objArray) {
        line.append(obj).append(" ");
    }
    
    System.out.println(line.toString().trim()); // Print the concatenated line, removing the trailing space
}
In this modified code:

We use a StringBuilder (line) to concatenate the elements of each Object[] array together into a single line.
Inside the inner loop, we use line.append(obj).append(" ") to append each element followed by a space to the StringBuilder.
After processing all elements in the Object[] array, we use line.toString().trim() to convert the StringBuilder to a string, removing the trailing space, and then print the resulting line using System.out.println().
This will print the elements of each Object[] array on a single line, with elements separated by spaces.




To print out the values in the commHist list, which contains Object[] elements returned by the repository.memETCommHist(202303) method, 
you can iterate through the list and then iterate through each Object[] array to access and print the individual elements. Here's how you can do it:


List<Object[]> commHist = repository.memETCommHist(202303);

for (Object[] objArray : commHist) {
    for (Object obj : objArray) {
        System.out.print(obj + " ");
    }
    System.out.println(); // Print a newline after each Object[] array
}
In the above code:

We first iterate through the commHist list, which contains Object[] arrays.
For each Object[] array (objArray) in the list, we iterate through the elements of the array.
We use System.out.print(obj + " ") to print each element followed by a space.
After printing all elements in an Object[] array, we print a newline (System.out.println();) to separate the output of each array.
This code will print out the values in the commHist list, one Object[] array at a time, with elements separated by spaces. Adjust the formatting as needed based on your specific requirements.




If you're getting java.lang.Object when printing an array of objects (Object[]), it means that the toString() method of each object in the array is 
returning the default implementation from the Object class, which only includes the class name and the object's hash code. To see meaningful values, 
you need to ensure that the toString() method for each object provides the desired output.

Here are a few approaches to ensure that you see meaningful values when printing an Object[]:

Override toString() Method: For custom classes that are part of the Object[], override the toString() method in each class to return a meaningful string representation. For example:
public class CustomObject {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    // ... constructors, getters, setters, etc.

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "CustomObject [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + "]";
    }
}

Use Arrays.toString(): If you're working with an Object[] containing standard Java types (e.g., integers, 
strings), you can use Arrays.toString() to get a more informative output

Object[] myArray = {1, "Hello", 3.14, new Date()};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(myArray));
This will print the array elements in a readable format.


Custom Formatting: If you have complex objects and want to print them in a specific format, 
you can iterate through the array and manually format the elements:

for (Object obj : myArray) {
    String formattedValue;
    if (obj instanceof CustomObject) {
        formattedValue = ((CustomObject) obj).getFormattedValue(); // Implement this method
    } else {
        formattedValue = obj.toString(); // Use the default toString()
    }
    System.out.println(formattedValue);
}
In this example, you would need to implement a getFormattedValue() method in your CustomObject class to return the desired string representation.

By ensuring that the toString() method or custom formatting logic returns meaningful values for each object in the array, you can get a more informative output when printing an Object[].
