In SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), there are several ways to get the query that a report executes when generating the report.

Using Report Manager:

Navigate to the Report Manager web portal.
Find your report in the list of reports and click on it to open.
In the toolbar, click on "View" and then select "Report Data."
This will display the dataset used in the report along with its query.
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

Connect to the SQL Server instance where your SSRS database is hosted.
Navigate to the database that holds the report data.
Expand the "Views" or "Tables" node to find the dataset used by the report.
Right-click on the dataset and select "Script as" > "SELECT to" > "New Query Editor Window" to see the query.
Report Server Database:

SSRS stores report metadata in its ReportServer database.
You can query the ReportServer database to get information about the reports, including their datasets and queries.
Here's an example query to get the query text for a specific report:
sql
SELECT CommandText
FROM [ReportServer].[dbo].[Catalog] C
JOIN [ReportServer].[dbo].[DataSet] DS ON C.ItemID = DS.ItemID
JOIN [ReportServer].[dbo].[DataSource] DsS ON DS.DataSourceID = DsS.ItemID
WHERE C.Name = 'YourReportName'

Exporting RDL:

If you have access to the Report Definition Language (RDL) file of the report, you can open it in a text editor to see the query.
Search for <Query> tags within the RDL file to find the query text.
Each of these methods provides a way to access the query that an SSRS report executes when generating the report. Choose the method that is most convenient for your situation.
