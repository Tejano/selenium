Migrating microservice applications from Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to OpenShift can involve several adjustments due to differences in the underlying platforms, especially when dealing with API gateways like Zuul. While the core configuration of your .NET Core and Spring Boot microservices might remain largely consistent, the way routing, service discovery, and network policies are handled can differ significantly between PCF and OpenShift. Here are a few areas to consider when troubleshooting and configuring Zuul in OpenShift:

Network Policies and Security Contexts
Network Policies: OpenShift utilizes network policies to control the flow of traffic between pods/services. 
If your API calls are not reaching the services, ensure that the appropriate network policies are in place to allow traffic from Zuul to your microservices.
Security Contexts: OpenShift has strict security policies that might block certain operations executed by containers. Review the security contexts of your Zuul gateway and microservices pods to ensure they have the necessary permissions.
Service Discovery
Platform Service Discovery: Both PCF and OpenShift provide their mechanisms for service discovery. 
In PCF, you might have used the Spring Cloud Services for service registration and discovery. 
OpenShift, however, relies on Kubernetes service objects and DNS for service discovery. 
Ensure your Zuul configuration aligns with OpenShift’s service discovery mechanisms.
Custom Service Discovery Configuration: If you're using Eureka or another service discovery 
tool integrated with Zuul, ensure that it's correctly configured to discover services in the OpenShift environment. This might involve adjusting service URLs or utilizing OpenShift's internal DNS.
Configuration and Environment Variables
Environment Variables: OpenShift allows the injection of environment variables into pods. 
Ensure that any environment-specific variables (e.g., service URLs, ports) required by Zuul or your microservices are correctly configured in OpenShift.
ConfigMaps and Secrets: Leverage OpenShift’s ConfigMaps and Secrets for externalizing 
configuration and sensitive data. If Zuul or any microservice requires specific configuration files or secrets, make sure they are correctly defined and mounted into your pods.
Ingress and Routing
Routes vs. Ingress: While PCF uses route services to manage incoming requests, OpenShift uses a combination
 of Ingress and Routes. Ensure that you have an OpenShift Route or Ingress configured for Zuul that correctly routes external requests to the gateway.
Path-Based Routing: If your Zuul gateway uses path-based routing, verify that the OpenShift Route or Ingress is correctly configured to handle these paths and forward them to Zuul.
Logging and Debugging
Logging: Increase the logging level for the Zuul gateway and microservices to troubleshoot and identify
 where the breakdown occurs. Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate misconfiguration or network issues.
OpenShift Tools: Utilize OpenShift CLI (oc) commands to inspect pod logs, describe pods/services, 
and check network policies. These tools can be invaluable for diagnosing issues.
Documentation and Community
Consult the OpenShift and Zuul documentation for specific configuration examples and best practices.
Consider reaching out to the OpenShift community or forums for advice. Often, issues you're facing have been encountered and solved by others.
Remember, the transition from PCF to OpenShift involves not only migrating your applications but also 
adapting to the idiomatic patterns and practices of the target platform. It may require iterative adjustments to your configuration and deployment practices to fully leverage OpenShift's capabilities while ensuring your microservices operate as expected.
