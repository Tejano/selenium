In a Spring Boot application, you can configure Log4j for debugging to see SQL queries generated by Hibernate. Here are the steps to achieve this:

Add Log4j2 Dependency:
Make sure you have the Log4j2 dependency in your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
</dependency>

If you're using Maven, this will bring in the necessary dependencies for Log4j2.

Create Log4j2 Configuration:
Create a log4j2.xml file in the src/main/resources directory. Here's a basic configuration to log Hibernate SQL statements at the "debug" level:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Logger name="org.hibernate.SQL" level="debug" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
        </Logger>
        <Root level="error">
            <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>

This configuration logs Hibernate SQL statements at the "debug" level to the console.

Check Log Levels in application.properties or application.yml:
Ensure that the application's logging levels are set appropriately in your application.properties or application.yml:

For application.properties:
logging.level.org.springframework=INFO

For application.yml:

logging:
  level:
    org:
      springframework: INFO

This setting ensures that Spring Framework logs are shown at the "INFO" level.

Run Your Spring Boot Application:
Run your Spring Boot application, and Hibernate SQL statements will now be logged at the "debug" level to the console.

With these steps, you'll be able to configure Log4j2 to log Hibernate SQL queries at the desired logging level for debugging purposes in your Spring Boot application. Adjust the log levels and configurations according to your specific requirements.


Whether to use a properties file or a YAML file for configuring Spring Boot properties depends on personal preference, readability, and the complexity of the configuration you need for your application. Both formats have their own advantages and are commonly used in Spring Boot applications.

Here are some considerations for choosing between the two:

Readability and Ease of Use:
YAML generally tends to be more readable and allows for a more structured and hierarchical representation of data. It's often considered more user-friendly due to its indentation-based syntax, making it easier to understand complex configurations.

Conciseness:
YAML is often more concise and requires less syntax compared to properties files. It allows you to define complex data structures, lists, and maps in a more compact and readable way.

Complex Configurations:
If your application requires complex configurations with nested structures, arrays, or maps, YAML might be a better choice as it handles complex data types more naturally.

Simple Key-Value Pairs:
For simple key-value pairs, especially when the configuration is straightforward and doesn't require a hierarchical structure, properties files can be simpler and more familiar.

Spring Boot Convention:
Spring Boot conventionally uses application.properties or application.yml as the default configuration files. If you follow this convention, it might be easier for other developers to understand and work with your application.

Existing Knowledge and Preference:
Consider the familiarity and preference of your team or community. If your team is more accustomed to one format over the other, it might be beneficial to stick with what they are comfortable with.

In practice, the decision between using a properties file or YAML largely depends on your team's preference, the complexity of your configuration, and readability requirements. Some projects may even use both formats, using properties for simple configurations and YAML for more complex and structured settings. Ultimately, both formats are supported and widely used in Spring Boot, so choose the one that aligns with your development style and requirements.
