🚀 Configuring VS Code for React & Python Testing
1️⃣ Enable Format on Save
Open Settings (Ctrl + ,) → Search formatOnSave → Enable.
2️⃣ Set Default Formatters
Open settings.json (Ctrl + Shift + P → "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)").
Add:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter"
  }
}
3️⃣ Running Tests in VS Code
🟢 Run React Unit Tests (Jest)
Open VS Code terminal and run:
sh
Copy
Edit
npm test
Or, if using Playwright for React UI testing:
sh
Copy
Edit
npx playwright test
🟢 Run API Tests (Python + pytest)
Install required testing libraries:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install pytest requests
Run tests using:
sh
Copy
Edit
pytest tests/api_tests.py
🟢 Run UI Tests (Selenium/Playwright)
Playwright
sh
Copy
Edit
pytest tests/ui_tests.py
Selenium
sh
Copy
Edit
python tests/selenium_test.py

✅ Recommended Alternative for React UI Testing with Python
If you're testing React UIs using Python, the best approach is to use Selenium WebDriver or Playwright.

1️⃣ Selenium for React UI Testing
🔹 Install Selenium & WebDriver in Python
Run the following in your VS Code terminal:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
🔹 Install the required browser driver
If using Chrome, download ChromeDriver here
For Edge, download EdgeDriver here

🔹 Example Selenium Test for React UI
python
Copy
Edit
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Set up Selenium WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Open your React App
driver.get("http://localhost:3000")  # Replace with your React App URL

# Find an element by its React component ID (Example: button)
button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[text()='Click Me']")
button.click()

# Verify action
assert "Success" in driver.page_source

# Close browser
driver.quit()
2️⃣ Playwright for Faster React UI Testing
If Selenium is too slow, you can use Playwright, which is optimized for React and frontend testing.

🔹 Install Playwright in Python
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install playwright
playwright install
🔹 Example Playwright Test for React UI
python
Copy
Edit
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set headless=True for faster testing
    page = browser.new_page()
    
    page.goto("http://localhost:3000")  # Replace with your React App URL
    
    page.click("text=Click Me")  # Clicks a button with text 'Click Me'
    
    assert "Success" in page.text_content("body")  # Check for success message
    
    browser.close()
🎯 Best VS Code Extensions for React UI Testing
Since Selenium IDE is not available, use these instead:

For Selenium & Playwright UI Testing
Python (by Microsoft) – Essential for Python scripting
🔗 Install

Pylance – IntelliSense for Python
🔗 Install

Playwright Test for VS Code – Best for UI automation
🔗 Install

Python Test Explorer – Runs and debugs Selenium/Playwright tests
🔗 Install

🎯 Which One Should You Use?
✅ Use Selenium → If you need to test UI interactions across multiple browsers.
✅ Use Playwright → If you need faster and more reliable UI tests for React apps.
