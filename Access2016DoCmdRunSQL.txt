Alternative: Use DoCmd.RunSQL
If you are simply running an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE query and donâ€™t need to dynamically create pass-through queries,
 you can also directly use DoCmd.RunSQL with warnings turned off:


Private Sub btnExecuteQuery_Click()
    Dim sqlUpdate As String

    ' Construct the SQL update query
    sqlUpdate = "UPDATE checklog " & _
                "SET replaced_by = '" & Me.txtReplacedBy & "', " & _
                "void_comments = '" & Me.txtVoidComments & "', " & _
                "check_comments = '" & Me.txtCheckComments & "' " & _
                "WHERE YourPrimaryKeyField = '" & Me.YourPrimaryKeyField & "';"

    ' Suppress warnings
    DoCmd.SetWarnings False

    ' Run the SQL update query
    DoCmd.RunSQL sqlUpdate

    ' Re-enable warnings
    DoCmd.SetWarnings True
End Sub
Conclusion:
By turning off and then re-enabling warnings around the execution of your pass-through query,
 you can effectively suppress the "no records returned" message without causing issues with
 your ODBC driver or needing to set ReturnsRecords = No.
