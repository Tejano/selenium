You can create a SQL Server script that identifies and cleans up SSIS jobs where the owner no longer exists as a valid SQL Server login. Below is a T-SQL script that can be used to identify such jobs and update their owners to a valid login (e.g., sa).

This script assumes you want to set the job owner to sa for jobs where the owner no longer exists.

-- Step 1: Identify jobs with invalid owners
SELECT 
    j.job_id,
    j.name AS JobName,
    j.owner_sid,
    l.name AS CurrentOwner
FROM 
    msdb.dbo.sysjobs j
LEFT JOIN 
    sys.server_principals l
ON 
    j.owner_sid = l.sid
WHERE 
    l.name IS NULL;  -- This indicates the owner is no longer a valid SQL Server login

-- Step 2: Update the job owner to 'sa' where the owner no longer exists
-- You can use a loop or an update query to change the owner of each job
DECLARE @job_id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;

DECLARE job_cursor CURSOR FOR 
SELECT j.job_id
FROM 
    msdb.dbo.sysjobs j
LEFT JOIN 
    sys.server_principals l
ON 
    j.owner_sid = l.sid
WHERE 
    l.name IS NULL;

OPEN job_cursor;

FETCH NEXT FROM job_cursor INTO @job_id;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    -- Update the job owner to 'sa'
    EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_update_job @job_id = @job_id, @owner_login_name = 'sa';
    
    FETCH NEXT FROM job_cursor INTO @job_id;
END;

CLOSE job_cursor;
DEALLOCATE job_cursor;

-- Step 3: Verify the jobs have been updated
SELECT 
    j.job_id,
    j.name AS JobName,
    l.name AS NewOwner
FROM 
    msdb.dbo.sysjobs j
JOIN 
    sys.server_principals l
ON 
    j.owner_sid = l.sid
WHERE 
    l.name = 'sa';

Script Explanation:
Step 1: Identify Jobs with Invalid Owners

This query finds jobs where the owner SID (owner_sid) does not match any existing logins in sys.server_principals. 
If a job owner does not exist, the name column from sys.server_principals will be NULL.
Step 2: Update Job Owner

A cursor is used to loop through each job with an invalid owner and update its owner to sa. 
The sp_update_job stored procedure is used to update the job owner.
Step 3: Verification

This step checks that the jobs have been successfully updated to the new owner (sa).
Before running this script, ensure you have proper permissions to modify SQL Server jobs, 
and review the jobs to ensure that changing their owners won't cause any issues.
