My thoughts coming into the program:

I was looking forward to taking this Dale Carnegie class because, as a software engineer, most of my self-learning has been focused on technical skills. 
I wanted to explore ways to improve my communication and interpersonal skills, especially in a professional setting.

What I soon found out:

I soon discovered that the principles and techniques we learned
 in this class could be directly applied to my current project. One of the key takeaways was the importance of effective communication, not just with my team but also with stakeholders. This has been particularly beneficial in explaining complex technical issues in a more understandable and relatable way.

What I learned:

Throughout the course, I learned how to build stronger relationships 
with my colleagues, foster a more collaborative environment, and handle difficult
 conversations with confidence and empathy. These skills have already started to make 
 a positive impact on my work, leading to more productive meetings and a more cohesive team dynamic.

How I will apply this:

Moving forward, I plan to continue integrating these communication strategies 
into my daily interactions. For instance, I am now more mindful of active listening and providing constructive feedback. This class has equipped me with the tools to not only enhance my technical projects but also to grow as a leader within my organization.

Conclusion:

Overall, the Dale Carnegie class has been an invaluable experience, providing 
me with practical skills that complement my technical expertise. I am excited to see the long-term benefits as I continue to apply these principles in both my professional and personal life.
