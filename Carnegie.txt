My thoughts coming into the program:

I was looking forward to taking this Dale Carnegie class because, as a software engineer, most of my self-learning has been focused on technical skills. I wanted to explore ways to 
improve my communication and interpersonal skills, especially in a professional setting.

What I soon found out:

I soon discovered that the principles and techniques we 
learned in this class could be directly applied to my current project. One of the key takeaways was the importance of effective communication, not just with my team but also with stakeholders. This has been particularly beneficial in explaining complex technical issues in a more understandable and relatable way.

What I learned about myself:

Through the course, I learned that I have some habits that 
don't align with the Golden Book principles. This realization came 
when I was discussing the class with my wife, and she pointed out some of these habits.
 It was a moment of self-awareness that highlighted areas where I could improve to become 
 more effective and empathetic in my interactions.

How I will apply this:

Moving forward, I plan to continue integrating these 
communication strategies into my daily interactions. For instance, 
I am now more mindful of active listening and providing constructive feedback. 
This class has equipped me with the tools to not only enhance my technical projects but also to grow as a leader within my organization.

Conclusion:

Overall, the Dale Carnegie class has been an invaluable experience, providing me with practical skills that complement my technical expertise. I am excited to see the long-term benefits as I continue to apply these principles in both my professional and personal life.
