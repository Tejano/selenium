Creating a Spring Boot API that integrates with Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and connects through a 
Spring Boot Config Server involves multiple steps. Here's a general overview of how you can build this:

1. Set Up Your Spring Boot Project
Start by setting up a Spring Boot project. You can use Spring Initializr to bootstrap your project with the necessary dependencies.

Dependencies to include:
Spring Web
Spring Boot Actuator (optional, for monitoring and management)
Spring Boot Config Client
SQL Server Driver or any JDBC API
2. Configure Spring Boot Config Server
The Config Server is a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments. You need to set up a config server or use an existing one.

Set up a Spring Cloud Config Server:

Include the spring-cloud-config-server dependency in another Spring Boot project.
Annotate your main class with @EnableConfigServer.
Configure your application.properties or application.yml to specify the git or filesystem location of your configuration files.
Example application.yml for Config Server:
server:
  port: 8888
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://your-git-repository.com/config-repo
          clone-on-start: true
3. Connect Your Application to Config Server
In your application, specify the URI of your Config Server in bootstrap.yml or bootstrap.properties.

Example bootstrap.properties:
spring.application.name=ssis-job-executor
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
4. Connect to the MSSQL Server
Set up database connectivity in your application's properties file fetched from the Config Server.

Example properties in Config Server repository ssis-job-executor.properties:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://<server>;databaseName=<dbname>
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver

5. Create API Endpoints
Develop REST API endpoints in your application to execute and check the status of SSIS jobs.

Controller Example:
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/ssis")
public class SSISController {

    @Autowired
    private SSIService ssisService;

    @PostMapping("/execute-job")
    public ResponseEntity<String> executeJob(@RequestParam String jobName) {
        String status = ssisService.executeJob(jobName);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(status);
    }

    @GetMapping("/job-status/{jobId}")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getJobStatus(@PathVariable String jobId) {
        String status = ssisService.getJobStatus(jobId);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(status);
    }
}
6. Implementing SSIS Job Execution
You'll need to interact with the SSIS server using its API or by executing commands that trigger SSIS packages. This might involve calling stored procedures or using a command line tool from Java.

SSIS Service Example:
public class SSIService {
    public String executeJob(String jobName) {
        // Logic to execute job on SSIS
        return "Job started";
    }

    public String getJobStatus(String jobId) {
        // Logic to check job status
        return "Running";
    }
}

7. Testing and Deployment
Finally, test your API thoroughly to ensure that it can execute and monitor SSIS jobs correctly. Deploy your application and the Config Server.

Note
Directly interacting with SSIS from Java can be complex due to the lack of a straightforward API for job control. 
You might need to rely on calling stored procedures or using external scripts to manage SSIS jobs,
 which could involve additional security and performance considerations.

Conclusion
This setup enables you to have a scalable, manageable, and centralized configuration 
for your Spring Boot application interfacing with SSIS. You will also be able to 
integrate this API with a single-page application by allowing API endpoints to be called for executing and monitoring jobs.

User
when you execute a job you use the sp_start_job stored procedure,   
how do you return a response that the job actually started and check on the job status.

Using the sp_start_job stored procedure to start an SSIS job and checking on its status in SQL Server requires a specific approach since sp_start_job itself does not provide immediate feedback on job success or failureâ€”it only initiates the job. Below, I'll detail how to execute a job and then how to check its status.

Executing a Job with sp_start_job
When you invoke sp_start_job, the job is started asynchronously. The procedure returns 
success as soon as the job is sent to the SQL Server Agent for execution, not when the job completes.

To execute sp_start_job from Java, you can use JDBC to call this stored procedure. Here's how you can do it:
import java.sql.*;

public boolean startJob(String jobName) {
    String connectionUrl = "jdbc:sqlserver://yourserver;databaseName=msdb;user=youruser;password=yourpassword;";

    try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionUrl);
         CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall("{call sp_start_job(?)}")) {
        cstmt.setString(1, jobName);
        cstmt.execute();
        return true; // Assuming job starts successfully
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return false;
    }
}
Checking Job Status
To check the status of a job, you can query the sysjobactivity and sysjobs tables in the msdb database. 
The current_execution_status field in sysjobactivity will tell you the status of the job:

0 = Not idle or suspended.
1 = Executing.
2 = Waiting for thread.
3 = Between retries.
4 = Idle.
5 = Suspended.
7 = Performing completion actions.
Here is a method to check job status using JDBC:
import java.sql.*;

public String getJobStatus(String jobName) {
    String connectionUrl = "jdbc:sqlserver://yourserver;databaseName=msdb;user=youruser;password=yourpassword;";
    String query = "SELECT j.name, a.current_execution_status FROM msdb.dbo.sysjobs j " +
                   "JOIN msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity a ON j.job_id = a.job_id " +
                   "WHERE j.name = ? AND a.session_id = (SELECT MAX(session_id) FROM msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity WHERE job_id = j.job_id)";

    try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionUrl);
         PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {
        pstmt.setString(1, jobName);
        try (ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {
            if (rs.next()) {
                int status = rs.getInt("current_execution_status");
                switch (status) {
                    case 1:
                        return "Executing";
                    case 4:
                        return "Idle";
                    case 5:
                        return "Suspended";
                    case 7:
                        return "Performing completion actions";
                    default:
                        return "Unknown";
                }
            } else {
                return "Job not found";
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return "Error retrieving job status";
    }
}
Handling Asynchronous Nature
Since sp_start_job starts the job asynchronously, after calling startJob, you might want to either:

Poll the status: Periodically call getJobStatus until you get a completion status (Idle, Suspended, or another end status).
Notification: Implement a mechanism where SQL Server can notify your application upon job completion.
 This could be done using SQL Server Service Broker or an external trigger to call back to your application.
Integrating into Spring Boot
These methods can be integrated into a service class in Spring Boot, where they can be 
called by controllers based on API requests, thus providing real-time job management capabilities through your API.

so from the react ui a button executes the job,   how do I present to the user in a message the status of that job?

To present the status of an SSIS job in a React UI after executing it from a button click, you will need to handle 
both the initiation and the status tracking of the job. Here's how you can structure your solution:

1. React Frontend (UI)
a. Button to Trigger the Job
You can create a button in your React component that, when clicked, triggers an API call to your Spring Boot backend to start the job.

b. Displaying Job Status
After triggering the job, you can display the job's status in the UI. This might involve polling the server at intervals 
to fetch the latest job status or implementing a more complex real-time update mechanism like WebSockets.

Here's a basic example of how you might set this up in a React component:
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function JobExecutor() {
  const [jobStatus, setJobStatus] = useState('Idle');
  const [jobId, setJobId] = useState(null);
  const [intervalId, setIntervalId] = useState(null);

  const handleStartJob = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('http://your-api-url/api/ssis/execute-job', { jobName: 'yourJobName' });
      setJobId(response.data.jobId); // Assuming the API returns a jobId
      setJobStatus('Executing');
      pollJobStatus(response.data.jobId);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error starting job:', error);
    }
  };

  const pollJobStatus = (jobId) => {
    const id = setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(`http://your-api-url/api/ssis/job-status/${jobId}`);
        setJobStatus(response.data.status);
        if (response.data.status === 'Idle' || response.data.status === 'Error') {
          clearInterval(id);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching job status:', error);
      }
    }, 5000); // Poll every 5 seconds
    setIntervalId(id);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (intervalId) clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, [intervalId]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleStartJob}>Start Job</button>
      <p>Job Status: {jobStatus}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default JobExecutor;

2. Spring Boot Backend (API)
Ensure your Spring Boot backend provides endpoints for both starting the job and querying its status as previously described. You might also want to modify these to better fit the interaction with your frontend:

a. Start Job Endpoint
This endpoint should start the job and return a job ID or other identifier that can be used to query the status.

b. Job Status Endpoint
This endpoint should accept a job ID and return the current status of the job.

3. Considerations for Production
a. Error Handling
Make sure to handle errors both on the client and server sides. This includes handling cases where the job does not start correctly or when status updates fail.

b. Security
Ensure that your API is secured and that only authenticated users can execute jobs and check their statuses.

c. Efficiency
Polling every few seconds might not be the most efficient way to handle status updates, especially with multiple users or jobs. Consider using WebSockets for a real-time, bidirectional communication channel between your React app and the Spring Boot server.

This setup provides a robust framework for executing SSIS jobs from a React UI and dynamically displaying the job status. Adjust the polling interval and the API according to your specific application needs and server load.
