First, ensure you have the necessary imports for time measurement:

import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.Instant;

2. Modify the Comparison Service to Track Time
You'll add time tracking at the start and end of each page processing, as well as for the total process

@Service
public class PostRuleComparisonService {

    @Autowired
    private Server2016Repository repository2016;

    @Autowired
    private Server2019Repository repository2019;

    public void comparePostRuleData(String yearMonth) {
        int pageSize = 10000;
        int pageNumber = 0;
        boolean allPagesProcessed = false;

        Set<Dto> uniqueIn2016 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Dto> uniqueIn2019 = new HashSet<>();

        // Start timing the total process
        Instant startTotal = Instant.now();

        while (!allPagesProcessed) {
            Instant startPage = Instant.now(); // Start timing for this page

            Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize);
            Page<Dto> page2016 = repository2016.getProcessedData(yearMonth, pageable);
            Page<Dto> page2019 = repository2019.getProcessedData(yearMonth, pageable);

            // Comparison logic...

            allPagesProcessed = page2016.isLast() && page2019.isLast();
            pageNumber++;

            Instant endPage = Instant.now(); // End timing for this page
            System.out.println("Time taken for page " + pageNumber + ": " + Duration.between(startPage, endPage).toMillis() + " ms");
        }

        Instant endTotal = Instant.now(); // End timing the total process
        System.out.println("Total time taken: " + Duration.between(startTotal, endTotal).toMillis() + " ms");

        // Process the unique records as needed
    }
}
Explanation
Instant.now() is used to record the current time at various points.
Duration.between(start, end).toMillis() calculates the time difference between two instants in milliseconds.
The time taken for each page is printed after each page is processed.
The total time taken for the entire process is printed after all pages have been processed.
Considerations
Logging: Instead of using System.out.println, it's recommended to use a proper logging framework 
like SLF4J. This allows better control over the logging levels and destinations (e.g., console, files, monitoring systems).
Performance Impact: While time tracking has a minimal performance impact, it's still additional processing.
 Keep this in mind, especially if your application is highly performance-sensitive.
Granularity: This method measures time in milliseconds, which is usually sufficient for most use cases. 
If you need higher precision (e.g., nanoseconds), Java's System.nanoTime() can be used, but its precision and accuracy can vary between systems.
By implementing these changes, you'll get a good understanding of the time taken for each part of your comparison process,
 which is invaluable for performance tuning and debugging.
