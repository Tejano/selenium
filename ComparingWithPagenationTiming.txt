First, ensure you have the necessary imports for time measurement:

import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.Instant;

2. Modify the Comparison Service to Track Time
You'll add time tracking at the start and end of each page processing, as well as for the total process

@Service
public class PostRuleComparisonService {

    @Autowired
    private Server2016Repository repository2016;

    @Autowired
    private Server2019Repository repository2019;

    public void comparePostRuleData(String yearMonth) {
        int pageSize = 10000;
        int pageNumber = 0;
        boolean allPagesProcessed = false;

        Set<Dto> uniqueIn2016 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Dto> uniqueIn2019 = new HashSet<>();

        // Start timing the total process
        Instant startTotal = Instant.now();

        while (!allPagesProcessed) {
            Instant startPage = Instant.now(); // Start timing for this page

            Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize);
            Page<Dto> page2016 = repository2016.getProcessedData(yearMonth, pageable);
            Page<Dto> page2019 = repository2019.getProcessedData(yearMonth, pageable);

            // Comparison logic...

            allPagesProcessed = page2016.isLast() && page2019.isLast();
            pageNumber++;

            Instant endPage = Instant.now(); // End timing for this page
			long timeTakenForPage = Duration.between(startPage, endPage).getSeconds();
            System.out.println("Time taken for page " + pageNumber + ": " + Duration.between(startPage, endPage).toMillis() + " ms");
			System.out.println("Time taken for page " + pageNumber + ": " + timeTakenForPage + " seconds");
        }

        Instant endTotal = Instant.now(); // End timing the total process
        System.out.println("Total time taken: " + Duration.between(startTotal, endTotal).toMillis() + " ms");
        long totalProcessTime = Duration.between(startTotal, endTotal).getSeconds();
        System.out.println("Total time taken: " + totalProcessTime + " seconds");
        // Process the unique records as needed
    }
}
Explanation
Instant.now() is used to record the current time at various points.
Duration.between(start, end).toMillis() calculates the time difference between two instants in milliseconds.
The time taken for each page is printed after each page is processed.
The total time taken for the entire process is printed after all pages have been processed.
Considerations
Logging: Instead of using System.out.println, it's recommended to use a proper logging framework 
like SLF4J. This allows better control over the logging levels and destinations (e.g., console, files, monitoring systems).
Performance Impact: While time tracking has a minimal performance impact, it's still additional processing.
 Keep this in mind, especially if your application is highly performance-sensitive.
Granularity: This method measures time in milliseconds, which is usually sufficient for most use cases. 
If you need higher precision (e.g., nanoseconds), Java's System.nanoTime() can be used, but its precision and accuracy can vary between systems.
By implementing these changes, you'll get a good understanding of the time taken for each part of your comparison process,
 which is invaluable for performance tuning and debugging.
 
 Compare with Projection:
 To utilize ModelMapper for converting projections to DTOs in your data comparison method, you'll first need to set up ModelMapper in your application. Then, you can use it in your service layer to efficiently map projection objects to DTOs.

Step 1: Define the Projection Interface
Define an interface with getter methods for the fields you need in the comparison:
public interface YourProjection {
    // Define getters for the fields used in comparison
    String getField1();
    String getField2();
    // Add other fields necessary for the comparison
}
Step 2: Modify the Repository
Adjust your repository methods to use the projection and support pagination:

public interface YourRepository extends JpaRepository<YourEntity, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT field1, field2 FROM YourEntity WHERE yearMonth = :yearMonth AND ruleId IS NOT NULL")
    Page<YourProjection> findDataByYearMonthWithRuleId(@Param("yearMonth") String yearMonth, Pageable pageable);
}



Step 3: Add ModelMapper Dependency
Add the ModelMapper library to your project's dependencies. In your pom.xml, include:
 <dependency>
    <groupId>org.modelmapper</groupId>
    <artifactId>modelmapper</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.4</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
</dependency>

 Step 4: Configure ModelMapper Bean
Configure a ModelMapper bean in your Spring configuration. This can be done in a configuration class:
 
 @Configuration
public class ModelMapperConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public ModelMapper modelMapper() {
        return new ModelMapper();
    }
}

Step 5: Implement the Service with ModelMapper
Now, in your service, inject the ModelMapper and use it to convert projections to DTOs
 
 @Service
public class DataComparisonService {

    @Autowired
    private YourRepository repository2016;

    @Autowired
    private YourRepository repository2019;

    @Autowired
    private ModelMapper modelMapper;

    public List<YourDto> compareDataAndConvertToDto(String yearMonth) {
        int pageSize = 10000;
        int pageNumber = 0;
        boolean allPagesProcessed = false;

        Set<YourProjection> uniqueProjections = new HashSet<>();

        while (!allPagesProcessed) {
            Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize);

            Page<YourProjection> page2016 = repository2016.findDataByYearMonthWithRuleId(yearMonth, pageable);
            Page<YourProjection> page2019 = repository2019.findDataByYearMonthWithRuleId(yearMonth, pageable);

            Set<YourProjection> set2016 = new HashSet<>(page2016.getContent());
            Set<YourProjection> set2019 = new HashSet<>(page2019.getContent());

            // Find unique in both sets
            uniqueProjections.addAll(set2016.stream().filter(e -> !set2019.contains(e)).collect(Collectors.toSet()));
            uniqueProjections.addAll(set2019.stream().filter(e -> !set2016.contains(e)).collect(Collectors.toSet()));

            allPagesProcessed = page2016.isLast() && page2019.isLast();
            pageNumber++;
        }

        // Convert unique projections to DTOs
        return convertToDtoList(uniqueProjections);
    }

    private List<YourDto> convertToDtoList(Set<YourProjection> projections) {
        return projections.stream()
                          .map(this::convertToDto)
                          .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    private YourDto convertToDto(YourProjection projection) {
        return modelMapper.map(projection, YourDto.class);
    }
}

To adjust the compareDataAndConvertToDto method to include unique2016, unique2019, and allDifferences (a combination of unique2016 and unique2019), and then convert these sets to lists using ModelMapper, you can follow this approach:

Step 1: Implement the Comparison Logic
Adjust the comparison logic to separate the unique records for each year and then combine them to form allDifferences.
@Service
public class DataComparisonService {

    @Autowired
    private YourRepository repository2016;

    @Autowired
    private YourRepository repository2019;

    @Autowired
    private ModelMapper modelMapper;

    public void compareDataAndConvertToDto(String yearMonth) {
        int pageSize = 10000;
        int pageNumber = 0;
        boolean allPagesProcessed = false;

        Set<YourProjection> uniqueIn2016 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<YourProjection> uniqueIn2019 = new HashSet<>();

        while (!allPagesProcessed) {
            Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize);

            Page<YourProjection> page2016 = repository2016.findDataByYearMonthWithRuleId(yearMonth, pageable);
            Page<YourProjection> page2019 = repository2019.findDataByYearMonthWithRuleId(yearMonth, pageable);

            Set<YourProjection> currentPageSet2016 = new HashSet<>(page2016.getContent());
            Set<YourProjection> currentPageSet2019 = new HashSet<>(page2019.getContent());

            uniqueIn2016.addAll(currentPageSet2016.stream().filter(e -> !currentPageSet2019.contains(e)).collect(Collectors.toSet()));
            uniqueIn2019.addAll(currentPageSet2019.stream().filter(e -> !currentPageSet2016.contains(e)).collect(Collectors.toSet()));

            allPagesProcessed = page2016.isLast() && page2019.isLast();
            pageNumber++;
        }

        List<YourDto> unique2016List = convertToDtoList(uniqueIn2016);
        List<YourDto> unique2019List = convertToDtoList(uniqueIn2019);

        Set<YourProjection> allDifferencesSet = new HashSet<>(uniqueIn2016);
        allDifferencesSet.addAll(uniqueIn2019);
        List<YourDto> allDifferencesList = convertToDtoList(allDifferencesSet);

        // Process the lists as needed (e.g., log, store, or return)
    }

    private List<YourDto> convertToDtoList(Set<YourProjection> projections) {
        return projections.stream()
                          .map(this::convertToDto)
                          .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    private YourDto convertToDto(YourProjection projection) {
        return modelMapper.map(projection, YourDto.class);
    }
}
Explanation
uniqueIn2016 and uniqueIn2019 are sets that store unique projections for each year.
After the comparison, these sets are converted to lists of DTOs (unique2016List and unique2019List) using convertToDtoList.
allDifferencesSet is a combined set of uniqueIn2016 and uniqueIn2019, which is then converted to a list of DTOs (allDifferencesList).
Step 2: Handling the Results
Once you have the lists unique2016List, unique2019List, and allDifferencesList, you can process them according to 
your application's requirements. This might involve saving them to a database, returning them in an API response, logging, or any other action.

Considerations
Performance: This approach might involve significant processing, especially with large datasets. Monitor and optimize the performance and memory usage.
ModelMapper Configuration: Ensure that ModelMapper is properly configured to handle the mapping from your projections to DTOs. 
Complex mappings might require additional configuration.
Parallel Processing: If performance is a concern, consider parallelizing the stream operations for converting sets to lists, but be 
cautious of thread safety and the overhead of parallelism.
By following this approach, you efficiently compare large datasets, identify unique records, 
and convert the results into DTOs for further processing.

This can be set as a Hibernate property in Spring Boot:
spring.jpa.properties.javax.persistence.query.timeout=20000

3. Socket Timeout
The socket timeout sets the timeout for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets



The @Transactional(timeout = 10) annotation in Spring Boot is typically used in the service layer of your application. This annotation is placed on either the class or method level to indicate that the enclosed method or all the methods of the class should be run within a transactional context. The timeout attribute specifically sets the duration in seconds after which the transaction should be automatically rolled back if it has not completed.

Here's how to use it:
@Service
public class YourService {

    @Transactional(timeout = 10) // Timeout in 10 seconds
    public void someDatabaseOperation() {
        // Your database logic here
    }

    // Other methods
}
2. Class-Level Usage
Alternatively, you can set a default transaction timeout for all methods in a service class by placing the annotation at the class level:
@Service
@Transactional(timeout = 10) // Default timeout for all methods
public class YourService {

    public void someDatabaseOperation() {
        // Your database logic here
    }

    public void anotherDatabaseOperation() {
        // Another method that will also have the 10-second timeout
    }

    // Other methods
}
JVM Memory Settings: Configure the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) settings to optimize memory usage. 
Allocate sufficient heap space for your application. For instance, you might start by allocating 8-16 GB to the JVM,
 depending on what other applications are running on your laptop.

Example JVM settings:
-Xms8g -Xmx16g
This sets the initial heap size (-Xms) to 8 GB and the maximum heap size (-Xmx) to 16 GB.

Garbage Collection (GC): Choose an appropriate garbage collector and tune its settings if necessary. Modern JVMs 
like OpenJDK 11 or later come with efficient garbage collectors like G1GC, which are good for applications with large heaps.
