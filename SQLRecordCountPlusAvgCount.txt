If you have two tables with record counts and two tables with average counts, and you want to sum them together, you can achieve this by separately calculating 
the total counts and average counts from each table, and then summing them up. Here's how you can do it:

SELECT 
    SUM(total_count) + SUM(avg_count) AS combined_count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS total_count,
        0 AS avg_count
    FROM 
        table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS total_count,
        0 AS avg_count
    FROM 
        table2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        0 AS total_count,
        AVG(column_name) AS avg_count
    FROM 
        table3
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        0 AS total_count,
        AVG(column_name) AS avg_count
    FROM 
        table4
) AS subquery;
