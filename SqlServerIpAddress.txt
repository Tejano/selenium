Yes, you can obtain the IP address of the server where SQL Server is running by executing a SQL query within the SQL Server environment. Here is a method to get
 the IP address of a SQL Server 2019 instance using Transact-SQL (T-SQL):
 
 SELECT 
    client_net_address AS 'IP Address'
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_connections
WHERE 
    session_id = @@SPID;

Yes, you can obtain the IP address of the server where SQL Server is running by executing a SQL query within the SQL Server environment. Here is a method to get the IP address of a SQL Server 2019 instance using Transact-SQL (T-SQL):

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    client_net_address AS 'IP Address'
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_connections
WHERE 
    session_id = @@SPID;
	
This query returns the IP address of the client that is connected to the SQL Server.
 @@SPID is the server process ID of the current session. If you are looking for the IP address of the server itself, 
you can use the following query, which retrieves the IP address of the SQL Server machine:	

SELECT 
    local_net_address AS 'IP Address'
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_connections
WHERE 
    session_id = @@SPID;
	
	
local_net_address shows the IP address of the SQL Server. If you are connected 
directly on the server, it might return NULL for connections via shared memory.
 To get comprehensive network interface information, you might need to access the 
 operating system's network configuration directly, for instance, by using xp_cmdshell to execute ipconfig or similar 
commands, though this requires appropriate permissions and that xp_cmdshell is enabled:

EXEC xp_cmdshell 'ipconfig';

However, enabling xp_cmdshell and using it to run system commands can pose a security risk, so it 
should be done with caution and only when necessary, following best security practices.
