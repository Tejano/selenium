Approach 2: Programmatically Sorting in VBA
If you are dynamically setting the sort in the OnOpen event using VBA, you can also specify both the dynamic sorting field and the month field for the secondary sort.
 Hereâ€™s how you would modify the previous example:
 
 Private Sub Report_Open(Cancel As Integer)
    Dim sortField As String
    
    If [CommType] = "PDP" Or [CommType] = "FeeFlat" Or [CommType] = "RxDs" Then
        If [PricingLevel] = "Carrier ID" Then
            sortField = "[Div_ID]"
        ElseIf [PricingLevel] = "Contract ID" Then
            sortField = "[Contract_ID]"
        Else
            sortField = "[Group_ID]"
        End If
    Else
        sortField = "[Group_ID]"
    End If
    
    ' Set the Order By to both the dynamic sort field and the constant month field
    Me.OrderBy = sortField & ", [YearMonth]"
    Me.OrderByOn = True
End Sub
