To create a Spring Boot gateway server that routes requests to three microservices (accounts, carrier, 
and client), you can use the Spring Cloud Gateway project. Below is an example of how to set this up.

1. Create a Spring Boot Gateway Project
You can start by creating a Spring Boot project with spring-cloud-starter-gateway dependency.

pom.xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>{spring-cloud-version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

Replace {spring-cloud-version} with the appropriate version of Spring Cloud compatible with your Spring Boot version.

2. Configure the Gateway Routes
In your application.yml (or application.properties), define the routes to your microservices:

application.yml:
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: accounts-service
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/accounts/**
          filters:
            - StripPrefix=1
        - id: carrier-service
          uri: http://localhost:8082
          predicates:
            - Path=/carrier/**
          filters:
            - StripPrefix=1
        - id: client-service
          uri: http://localhost:8083
          predicates:
            - Path=/client/**
          filters:
            - StripPrefix=1
3. Run the Gateway
Run your Spring Boot application. The gateway will now route requests:

http://localhost:8080/accounts/** to the accounts service
http://localhost:8080/carrier/** to the carrier service
http://localhost:8080/client/** to the client service
The StripPrefix=1 filter removes the first segment of the request path, so /accounts/something becomes /something 
when forwarded to the accounts service.

4. Microservices Setup
Ensure that each of your microservices (accounts, carrier, client) is running and accessible 
at the URIs specified in the gateway configuration (http://localhost:8081, http://localhost:8082, 
and http://localhost:8083 respectively).

5. Testing
You can test the setup by sending requests to your gateway's address (e.g., 
http://localhost:8080) with the appropriate path, and it should forward the request to the corresponding microservice.

This example assumes that the microservices are running locally on different ports. 
In a production environment, these would likely be separate hosts or containers, and you would use service discovery or direct URLs to route the requests appropriately.
