In SQL Server, the information about proxy accounts, including the underlying Windows account details (such as the account name) used by the proxy,
 is stored within SQL Server system tables. However, 
 directly querying system tables to retrieve Windows account details 
 for a proxy account is not straightforward because the password is encrypted 
 and not visible for security reasons. You can, however, find out the associated Windows account username.

To find the proxy account's Windows account details (specifically, the username),
 you can use the following SQL query, which joins relevant system views to extract the information:
 
 SELECT 
    sp.name AS ProxyName,
    sp.credential_id,
    sc.name AS CredentialName,
    sc.identity AS AssociatedWindowsAccount
FROM msdb.dbo.sysproxies AS sp
JOIN msdb.dbo.syscredentials AS sc ON sp.credential_id = sc.credential_id;

This query retrieves the name of the proxy (ProxyName), the credential ID associated with the proxy, the name of the credential (CredentialName), and the identity used for the credential, which is the Windows account username (AssociatedWindowsAccount).

Here's a breakdown of the elements in the query:

msdb.dbo.sysproxies: This system view contains information about the proxy accounts defined in SQL Server Agent.
msdb.dbo.syscredentials: This system view contains information about the credentials stored in SQL Server,
including the identity (Windows account username) associated with each credential.
Remember, the actual passwords for these Windows accounts are not accessible 
ia these queries due to security reasons. If you need to use a proxy account for 
running jobs and you're unsure about the password, you may need to reset the 
password in Active Directory (or another authentication system)
 and update the credential in SQL Server accordingly,
 following your organization's security policies.
