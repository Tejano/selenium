Steps to Enable Updates for Specific Fields:
1. Design the Master-Detail Form
Set up the form to display data from the SQL Server view.
Bind the form fields to the view, but remember that updates won't work directly.
2. Identify the Updatable Fields
Clearly mark which fields should be editable (e.g., allow users to type in them).
Use unbound textboxes for these fields to allow user input without attempting to directly modify the view.
3. Store the Primary Key or Unique Identifier
Ensure the view includes a primary key or a unique identifier for each record.
Bind this identifier to a hidden control in the form so it can be referenced when updating data.
4. Handle Updates via VBA
Add a save button or use the AfterUpdate event for the unbound controls to trigger updates.
Use a passthrough query or an action query in VBA to execute an UPDATE statement on the SQL Server table(s).


Private Sub btnSave_Click()
    Dim sql As String
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim recordID As Long
    Dim newValue1 As String
    Dim newValue2 As String

    ' Get the values from the form controls
    recordID = Me.txtPrimaryKey.Value ' Assume txtPrimaryKey holds the primary key
    newValue1 = Me.txtField1.Value ' New value for the first updatable field
    newValue2 = Me.txtField2.Value ' New value for the second updatable field

    ' Construct the SQL UPDATE statement
    sql = "UPDATE TableName SET Field1 = '" & newValue1 & "', Field2 = '" & newValue2 & "' " & _
          "WHERE PrimaryKeyField = " & recordID

    ' Execute the passthrough query
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef("")
    qdf.Connect = "ODBC;DSN=YourDSNName;UID=YourUsername;PWD=YourPassword"
    qdf.SQL = sql
    qdf.ReturnsRecords = False
    qdf.Execute dbFailOnError

    ' Refresh the form to display the updated values
    Me.Requery

    MsgBox "Record updated successfully!"
End Sub


To display the current field values in unbound textboxes, you can populate the textboxes programmatically using the form's Current event, which triggers whenever the form moves to a new record. Here's how you can achieve this:

Steps to Populate Unbound Textboxes with Current Values:
Add Unbound Textboxes

Add unbound textboxes to the form for the fields you want the user to update. These textboxes should not have a ControlSource.
Load Data into Textboxes

Use the form's Current event to load the current record's field values into the unbound textboxes.

Save Updated Data
Use a button or another event to save the updated values from the textboxes back to the database (as described earlier).

Example Code for Loading Current Values into Unbound Textboxes
Private Sub Form_Current()
    ' Load current values from the record into unbound textboxes
    Me.txtField1 = Nz(Me.Recordset!Field1, "") ' Replace 'Field1' with the actual field name
    Me.txtField2 = Nz(Me.Recordset!Field2, "")
    Me.txtField3 = Nz(Me.Recordset!Field3, "")
    Me.txtField4 = Nz(Me.Recordset!Field4, "")
End Sub

Nz Function: This ensures that null values in the recordset are displayed as empty strings in the textboxes.
Recordset: Refers to the current record in the form's recordset.

Example Code for Saving Updated Data Back to the Database
Add a "Save" button to the form with this VBA code:

Private Sub btnSave_Click()
    Dim sql As String
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim recordID As Long

    ' Get the primary key of the current record
    recordID = Me.txtPrimaryKey ' Assume txtPrimaryKey holds the primary key value

    ' Construct the SQL UPDATE statement with the updated values
    sql = "UPDATE TableName SET " & _
          "Field1 = '" & Me.txtField1 & "', " & _
          "Field2 = '" & Me.txtField2 & "', " & _
          "Field3 = '" & Me.txtField3 & "', " & _
          "Field4 = '" & Me.txtField4 & "' " & _
          "WHERE PrimaryKeyField = " & recordID

    ' Execute the passthrough query
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef("")
    qdf.Connect = "ODBC;DSN=YourDSNName;UID=YourUsername;PWD=YourPassword"
    qdf.SQL = sql
    qdf.ReturnsRecords = False
    qdf.Execute dbFailOnError

    MsgBox "Record updated successfully!"
End Sub
Key Considerations
Navigation

When the user navigates to a new record, the Form_Current event reloads the unbound textboxes with the current record's values.
Validation

Add validation to ensure only valid data is saved.
Performance

For large datasets, limit the number of fields displayed and updated.
User Experience

Consider disabling the textboxes or marking them as read-only until the user explicitly chooses to edit.
By combining unbound textboxes with programmatic data loading and saving, you maintain user-friendly functionality while adhering to the constraints of the SQL Server view.
