Step 1: Provide This VBA Function
This function takes two parameters:

TableName â†’ The name of the table they want to export
FilePath â†’ The destination of the exported Excel file
VBA Code: Export with MIP Label

Function ExportTableWithMIP(TableName As String, FilePath As String)
    Dim xlApp As Object
    Dim xlWB As Object
    Dim lblInfo As Object

    ' Ensure parameters are valid
    If TableName = "" Or FilePath = "" Then
        MsgBox "Table name or file path is missing.", vbExclamation, "Error"
        Exit Function
    End If

    ' Export table to Excel
    DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acExport, acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12Xml, TableName, FilePath, True

    ' Open Excel and apply MIP label
    Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    Set xlWB = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(FilePath)
    
    ' Apply Sensitivity Label (MIP)
    Set lblInfo = xlWB.SensitivityLabel.CreateLabelInfo()
    lblInfo.LabelId = "your-label-guid"  ' Replace with actual label GUID
    lblInfo.SetLabel = "Confidential Document"  ' Adjust as needed
    xlWB.SensitivityLabel.SetLabel lblInfo, lblInfo

    ' Save and close the file
    xlWB.Save
    xlWB.Close False
    xlApp.Quit

    ' Cleanup
    Set lblInfo = Nothing
    Set xlWB = Nothing
    Set xlApp = Nothing

    MsgBox "Exported and labeled: " & TableName, vbInformation, "Success"
End Function

Step 2: Instruct the Business Users on How to Use It in a Macro
Instead of modifying VBA, they continue using Macros:

Open Access and create a new Macro.

Select "RunCode".

In the "Function Name" field, enter:

ExportTableWithMIP("YourTableName", "C:\Exports\YourFile.xlsx")
Replace "YourTableName" with the actual table name.
Replace "C:\Exports\YourFile.xlsx" with the correct file path.
Save the macro and run it.

Step 3: Optional â€“ Let Users Choose Table & File Path Before Running the Macro
If the business team wants more flexibility, you can suggest: âœ” Creating a configuration table (tblExportConfig) where they define:

TableName
FilePath
ExportFlag (to select which tables to export) âœ” Or using a simple form where they enter the Table Name and File Path before running the macro.
Final Recommendation for the Business Users
ðŸ“Œ Option 1 (Recommended for Them):

Keep using Macros, but call the VBA function (ExportTableWithMIP) inside the macro.
ðŸ“Œ Option 2 (For More Control):

Store export details in a table (tblExportConfig), then run a macro that loops through the table and exports only selected tables.
ðŸ“Œ Option 3 (For Future Expansion):

If needed, they can add a form to enter table names & file paths before running the macro.
This approach keeps their process the same but adds MIP labeling with minimal changes. ðŸš€
