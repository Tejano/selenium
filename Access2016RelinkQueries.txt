Yes, the code to relink pass-through (PT) queries is very similar to relinking the tables. Pass-through queries in Access are linked directly to the SQL Server database, and their connection strings need to be updated when you switch environments (non-prod, prod, etc.).

Here's how you can handle relinking pass-through queries programmatically.

Steps for Relinking Pass-Through Queries:
Loop through the QueryDefs collection to find the pass-through queries.
Update the connection string for each pass-through query.
Ensure only pass-through queries are modified, as other types of queries (select, update, etc.) don't have a connection string.
Code Example to Relink Pass-Through Queries:

Sub RelinkPassThroughQueries()
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim newConnectionString As String
    
    ' Set the connection string dynamically based on the environment
    newConnectionString = "ODBC;DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=YourServer;DATABASE=YourDatabase;UID=YourUser;PWD=YourPassword;"
    
    ' Get the current database
    Set db = CurrentDb()
    
    ' Loop through all queries in the database
    For Each qdf In db.QueryDefs
        ' Check if it's a pass-through query
        If qdf.Type = dbQSQLPassThrough Then
            ' Update the connection string
            qdf.Connect = newConnectionString
            qdf.ReturnsRecords = True ' Set to False if it's an action query that doesn't return records
            
            ' Optionally, print to confirm the relink
            Debug.Print "Pass-through query " & qdf.Name & " relinked successfully."
        End If
    Next qdf

    ' Cleanup
    Set qdf = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
End Sub
