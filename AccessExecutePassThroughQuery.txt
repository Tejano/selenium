If you're getting a "Property Not Found" error when executing a Pass-Through (PT) query that inserts records into a table, the issue is likely because PT queries do not return recordsets but Access expects one.

Solution
Instead of using DoCmd.OpenQuery, you should use DAO.QueryDef.Execute, which is designed for action queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

Public Sub ExecutePassThroughQuery(queryName As String)
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler

    ' Reference the saved PT query
    Set qdf = CurrentDb.QueryDefs(queryName)

    ' Ensure it does not return records
    qdf.ReturnsRecords = False

    ' Execute the query (works for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    qdf.Execute dbFailOnError

    MsgBox "Pass-Through Query executed successfully!", vbInformation
    
    ' Cleanup
    Set qdf = Nothing
    Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "Error executing Pass-Through Query: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
    Set qdf = Nothing
End Sub

How to Use
Call this function in VBA, replacing "YourPTQueryName" with your actual query name:
ExecutePassThroughQuery "YourPTQueryName"

Why This Works
✔ Prevents Property Errors – PT Queries do not return records when used for inserts, so ReturnsRecords = False ensures no attempt is made to fetch results.
✔ Properly Executes Action Queries – Using .Execute dbFailOnError ensures proper execution and error handling.
✔ Bypasses Recordset Issues – Unlike DoCmd.OpenQuery, which expects a UI-bound result, .Execute runs queries directly.
