To build a test that navigates to the StandardReviewPage in your React application, you'll need to handle the 
conditional navigation logic based on whether the user is initially presented with the LoginPage 
or directly with the HomePage. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Page Object Classes
Firstly, create page object classes for LoginPage, HomePage, and StandardReviewPage.

LoginPage: Encapsulates the elements and actions of the login page.
HomePage: Represents the home page with methods to navigate to other pages, like StandardReviewPage.
StandardReviewPage: Contains the elements and functionalities of the standard review page.
2. WebDriver Configuration
Assuming the WebDriver is configured in a separate configuration class or file, ensure you can instantiate and access the WebDriver from your test classes.

3. Test Flow
In your test class, structure the flow based on the application’s behavior:

Navigate to the Application URL:

Start by navigating to the application's base URL. This will lead you to either the LoginPage or the HomePage, depending on the user's authentication state.
Conditional Handling:

Check whether the LoginPage is displayed. If it is, perform the login action.
If the HomePage is displayed directly, proceed to the next step.
Navigate to StandardReviewPage:

From the HomePage, invoke the method that navigates to the StandardReviewPage.
Perform Tests on StandardReviewPage:

Once on the StandardReviewPage, you can start executing your tests specific to that page.
4. Example Test Code
Here's a simplified example to illustrate the approach:
public class StandardReviewPageTest {
    private WebDriver driver;
    private LoginPage loginPage;
    private HomePage homePage;
    private StandardReviewPage standardReviewPage;

    @BeforeClass
    public void setup() {
        driver = WebDriverConfig.getDriver(); // Or however you initialize it
        loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
        homePage = new HomePage(driver);
        standardReviewPage = new StandardReviewPage(driver);
    }

    @Test
    public void testStandardReviewPage() {
        driver.get("http://yourappurl.com");

        if (loginPage.isDisplayed()) {
            loginPage.login("username", "password");
        }

        homePage.navigateToStandardReviewPage();
        // Now you are on the StandardReviewPage, and you can start testing it
        standardReviewPage.performSomeAction();
        // Add assertions or other test steps as needed
    }

    // ... other test methods and teardown method
}

In this example, isDisplayed() method in LoginPage should contain logic to determine if the login elements are present, indicating that the login page is displayed. Similarly, navigateToStandardReviewPage() in HomePage should encapsulate the logic to navigate to the StandardReviewPage.

5. Considerations
Test Independence: Ensure each test can run independently, especially if they are part of a larger test suite or CI/CD pipeline.
Session Management: Be mindful of how your application manages sessions. Tests may need to handle cookies or other session mechanisms to mimic user behavior accurately.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling in your tests to deal with unexpected application states or navigation issues.
This approach should help you build a test that adapts to the application's state, whether it requires login or direct navigation, and allows you to perform specific tests on the StandardReviewPage.
