If you need to find and update all jobs owned by a specific user in SSIS 2019,
you can use a T-SQL script that iterates through all jobs and updates the owner 
where the current owner matches your specified criteria. This approach is particularly 
useful if you have multiple jobs that need the owner changed and you want to automate the process.

Hereâ€™s a T-SQL script to accomplish this:

USE msdb;
GO

DECLARE @old_owner SYSNAME = 'current_owner_login_name';  -- Set the current owner's login name
DECLARE @new_owner SYSNAME = 'new_owner_login_name';      -- Set the new owner's login name

DECLARE job_cursor CURSOR FOR 
    SELECT job_id 
    FROM dbo.sysjobs 
    WHERE owner_sid = SUSER_SID(@old_owner);

DECLARE @job_id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER;

OPEN job_cursor;

FETCH NEXT FROM job_cursor INTO @job_id;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    EXEC dbo.sp_update_job 
        @job_id = @job_id,
        @owner_login_name = @new_owner;

    FETCH NEXT FROM job_cursor INTO @job_id;
END

CLOSE job_cursor;
DEALLOCATE job_cursor;

GO
