**"Thank you for the clarification regarding native MIP integration with Office 365 apps. While it works seamlessly for manual labeling within Office, our workflow creates Excel
files programmatically via Access VBA. Unfortunately, native MIP integration does not support automated labeling for files created outside of Office apps.

Microsoft recommends using either:

PowerShell with the AIP Unified Labeling Client to apply labels programmatically.
Set-AIPFileLabel Documentation
The Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) SDK for long-term programmatic solutions.
MIP SDK Overview
Without these tools, we cannot programmatically label the Excel files generated by Access VBA. For now, I recommend using the AIP Unified Labeling Client as it is Microsoft's supported solution for automated labeling. We can work towards integrating the MIP SDK for long-term compliance."**


Why Access VBA Differs from Excel VBA
Excel Object Model is Context-Sensitive:

The SensitivityLabel property and the SetLabel method depend on the context of the host application (Excel).
When running Excel VBA, the full Office Object Model for Excel, including sensitivity labeling, is available.
Limited Integration from Access VBA:

When automating Excel from Access, you are using late binding or a limited subset of Excel’s Object Model through COM automation.
This limited integration often excludes advanced properties like LabelInfo or the ability to interact with sensitivity labels using the same mechanism available in Excel.
Labeling Requires IDs:

The SetLabel method typically requires the label's GUID (ID), not just the display name, when called programmatically.
Using just the label name might work in some environments due to internal mappings, but this is inconsistent and not guaranteed.
Missing Office 365 Libraries in Access:

Access VBA does not include the advanced libraries that Excel VBA uses for sensitivity labeling.

How to Work Around This
To apply sensitivity labels programmatically from Access VBA, you must mimic Excel’s behavior by:

Providing the Label ID: Instead of relying on the name, use the label ID to set the sensitivity label.
Ensuring the Required Context: Use Excel directly to handle sensitivity labeling, even when initiated from Access.

Solution: Use LabelInfo in Access via Excel Automation
To bridge the gap, you can set up Access VBA to interact with Excel's LabelInfo object explicitly.

Updated VBA Code:
Sub ExportAndApplyLabel()
    Dim strFilePath As String
    Dim strTableName As String
    Dim xlApp As Object
    Dim xlWorkbook As Object
    Dim lblInfo As Object
    
    ' Export file path
    strFilePath = "C:\Path\To\ExportedFile.xlsx"
    strTableName = "YourTableName"
    
    ' Step 1: Export data to Excel
    DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acExport, acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12Xml, strTableName, strFilePath, True
    
    ' Step 2: Open Excel and apply sensitivity label
    Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    xlApp.Visible = False
    Set xlWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(strFilePath)
    
    ' Step 3: Access Sensitivity Label via LabelInfo
    On Error Resume Next
    Set lblInfo = xlWorkbook.SensitivityLabel.CreateLabelInfo()
    If lblInfo Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "Unable to access Sensitivity Labels in Excel.", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' Step 4: Set the label using the LabelInfo object
    lblInfo.LabelId = "Your-Label-GUID-Here"  ' Replace with the actual GUID of the label
    lblInfo.SetLabel "Automated labeling applied from Access"

    ' Save and close the workbook
    xlWorkbook.Save
    xlWorkbook.Close False
    xlApp.Quit
    
    ' Cleanup
    Set lblInfo = Nothing
    Set xlWorkbook = Nothing
    Set xlApp = Nothing
    
    MsgBox "File exported and labeled successfully!"
End Sub

Key Changes
Use the LabelInfo Object:

Access the label metadata explicitly via the SensitivityLabel.CreateLabelInfo() method.
Assign the label’s GUID (ID), not just the display name.
Label GUID:

Obtain the GUIDs for your organization’s labels from the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center or your IT team.

Obtain the Label GUIDs
To retrieve the GUIDs for the sensitivity labels:

Ask your IT team or Microsoft 365 administrator for the GUIDs.
Alternatively, if you have admin access:
Go to the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center.
Navigate to Information Protection > Labels.
View the label properties to find its unique GUID.

Why Name-Only Doesn’t Work
The label name displayed in Excel’s Sensitivity dropdown is a friendly alias.
Internally, Excel maps this alias to a GUID for accuracy and consistency across environments.
Programmatically, you must provide the GUID to ensure the label is applied correctly.

Testing and Debugging
Test the script with Excel VBA first to confirm it works.
Run the Access VBA script to ensure the integration with Excel behaves as expected.
Verify the applied label manually by opening the Excel file.
