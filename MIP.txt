**"Thank you for the clarification regarding native MIP integration with Office 365 apps. While it works seamlessly for manual labeling within Office, our workflow creates Excel
files programmatically via Access VBA. Unfortunately, native MIP integration does not support automated labeling for files created outside of Office apps.

Microsoft recommends using either:

PowerShell with the AIP Unified Labeling Client to apply labels programmatically.
Set-AIPFileLabel Documentation
The Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) SDK for long-term programmatic solutions.
MIP SDK Overview
Without these tools, we cannot programmatically label the Excel files generated by Access VBA. For now, I recommend using the AIP Unified Labeling Client as it is Microsoft's supported solution for automated labeling. We can work towards integrating the MIP SDK for long-term compliance."**
