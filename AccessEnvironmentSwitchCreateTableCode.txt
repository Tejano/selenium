To handle the environment switching by developers and administrators while ensuring that users can see the current environment,
 you can enhance the implementation with the following steps:

Environment Configuration: Store connection strings and set the current environment.
Environment Switching Logic: Allow developers and administrators to switch environments.
Display Current Environment: Ensure users can see the current environment.
Step-by-Step Implementation

Step 1: Environment Configuration
Store the connection strings in a table tblEnvironments and include a field for the current environment.

CREATE TABLE tblEnvironments (
    EnvironmentName VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    ConnectionString VARCHAR(255),
	tblEnvironments ADD COLUMN IsCurrent BOOLEAN;
);

INSERT INTO tblEnvironments (EnvironmentName, ConnectionString) VALUES ('DEV', 'Your_DEV_Connection_String','FALSE');
INSERT INTO tblEnvironments (EnvironmentName, ConnectionString) VALUES ('QA', 'Your_QA_Connection_String','FALSE');
INSERT INTO tblEnvironments (EnvironmentName, ConnectionString) VALUES ('UAT', 'Your_UAT_Connection_String','TRUE');
INSERT INTO tblEnvironments (EnvironmentName, ConnectionString) VALUES ('PROD', 'Your_PROD_Connection_String','FALSE');

Step 2: Update Initialization and Switching Logic
Update the code to use the IsCurrent field to determine and set the current environment.

Initialization Function:
' In a standard module
Public gstrCurrentEnvironment As String

Public Sub InitializeEnvironment()
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT EnvironmentName FROM tblEnvironments WHERE IsCurrent = TRUE", dbOpenSnapshot)
    
    If rs.EOF Then
        MsgBox "No current environment set!", vbCritical
        gstrCurrentEnvironment = "DEV"  ' Default to DEV if not set
    Else
        gstrCurrentEnvironment = rs!EnvironmentName
    End If
    
    rs.Close
    Set rs = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
End Sub

Switch Environment Function:
Public Sub SwitchEnvironment(newEnvironment As String)
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    Dim connString As String
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
    
    ' Get the new connection string
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT ConnectionString FROM tblEnvironments WHERE EnvironmentName = '" & newEnvironment & "'", dbOpenSnapshot)
    
    If rs.EOF Then
        MsgBox "Environment not found!", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    Else
        connString = rs!ConnectionString
    End If
    
    ' Loop through all linked tables and update the connection string
    For Each tdf In db.TableDefs
        If Len(tdf.Connect) > 0 Then
            If Left(tdf.Connect, 4) = "ODBC" Then
                tdf.Connect = "ODBC;" & connString
                tdf.RefreshLink
            End If
        End If
    Next tdf
    
    ' Update pass-through queries connection string
    For Each qdf In db.QueryDefs
        If qdf.Type = dbQSQLPassThrough Then
            qdf.Connect = "ODBC;" & connString
        End If
    Next qdf
    
    ' Update the IsCurrent field in the table
    db.Execute "UPDATE tblEnvironments SET IsCurrent = FALSE"
    db.Execute "UPDATE tblEnvironments SET IsCurrent = TRUE WHERE EnvironmentName = '" & newEnvironment & "'"
    
    ' Set the global variable for the current environment
    gstrCurrentEnvironment = newEnvironment
    
    MsgBox "Switched to " & newEnvironment & " environment.", vbInformation
    Exit Sub
    
ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "Error " & Err.Number & " (" & Err.Description & ") in procedure SwitchEnvironment"
End Sub

Public Function GetCurrentEnvironment() As String
    GetCurrentEnvironment = gstrCurrentEnvironment
End Function

Step 3: Create the Environment Switcher Form
Create a form frmEnvironmentSwitcher with a combo box (cboEnvironment) and a button (btnSwitch).

Form Design:

ComboBox (cboEnvironment): Row Source set to SELECT EnvironmentName FROM tblEnvironments
Button (btnSwitch): On Click event calls the SwitchEnvironment function.
Form Code:
Private Sub btnSwitch_Click()
    If Not IsNull(Me.cboEnvironment) Then
        Call SwitchEnvironment(Me.cboEnvironment)
        Me.lblCurrentEnvironment.Caption = "Current Environment: " & GetCurrentEnvironment()
    Else
        MsgBox "Please select an environment.", vbExclamation
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub Form_Load()
    Me.lblCurrentEnvironment.Caption = "Current Environment: " & GetCurrentEnvironment()
End Sub

Step 4: AutoExec Macro for Initialization
Create an AutoExec macro to open the environment switcher form and initialize the environment.

AutoExec Macro:

Add an action to run code: InitializeEnvironment
Add an action to open frmEnvironmentSwitcher.
Step 5: Display Current Environment to Users
Create a form to display the current environment to users.

Form Design:

Create a new form frmShowEnvironment.
Add a label lblCurrentEnvironment to display the current environment.

Form Code:

Private Sub Form_Load()
    Me.lblCurrentEnvironment.Caption = "Current Environment: " & GetCurrentEnvironment()
End Sub

Add to Startup Form:

If you have a main navigation form, include the frmShowEnvironment as a subform or display the current environment on the main form.
Example of Displaying Current Environment in Main Form
Main Form Code:
Private Sub Form_Load()
    ' Initialize environment
    Call InitializeEnvironment
    
    ' Display current environment
    Me.lblCurrentEnvironment.Caption = "Current Environment: " & GetCurrentEnvironment()
End Sub

Summary
Environment Configuration: Add a boolean IsCurrent field to indicate the current environment.
Switching Logic: Update the current environment and the IsCurrent field in the table.
Initialization: Initialize the environment on database open.
Display Current Environment: Ensure users can see the current environment via a form or main form label.
This approach ensures that the environment setting is globally accessible and modifiable by authorized users, while all users can see the current environment.
