FROM

Explanation:
COUNT(*): Counts all the records in the table.
FORMAT(GETDATE(), 'yyyyMM'): Fetches the current date and formats it to YYYYMM.
CAST(... AS INT): Converts the formatted date into an integer for comparison.
DATEADD(YEAR, 5, GETDATE()): Adds 5 years to the current date for future comparison.
SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END): Counts records that satisfy the specific conditions:
OlderThan10Years: Records where month_column is 10 years or older.
OlderThan10YearsIn5Years: Records where month_column will be 10 years or older 5 years from now.
Assumptions:
month_column is an integer in YYYYMM format.
The database supports GETDATE() (for SQL Server). If youâ€™re using a different RDBMS, let me know to adjust the query accordingly.
