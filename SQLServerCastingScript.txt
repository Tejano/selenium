Use Query-Based Filtering Techniques
Rely on TRY_CAST or TRY_CONVERT functions in production to find any data that doesnâ€™t conform to the DECIMAL(9,2) specification, helping to locate rows potentially causing the issue:

SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE TRY_CAST(YourDecimalColumn AS DECIMAL(9,2)) IS NULL
  AND YourDecimalColumn IS NOT NULL;


1. Find Indexes on the Column
Use this query to find indexes that include your column:
SELECT 
    i.name AS IndexName,
    i.type_desc AS IndexType,
    c.name AS ColumnName,
    t.name AS TableName
FROM 
    sys.indexes i
JOIN 
    sys.index_columns ic ON i.object_id = ic.object_id AND i.index_id = ic.index_id
JOIN 
    sys.columns c ON ic.object_id = c.object_id AND ic.column_id = c.column_id
JOIN 
    sys.tables t ON i.object_id = t.object_id
WHERE 
    t.name = 'YourTableName'
    AND c.name = 'YourColumnName';

2. Find Constraints on the Column
To check if the column is part of any constraints (such as PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, or CHECK constraints), use the following:

SELECT 
    tc.constraint_type,
    kcu.column_name,
    tc.constraint_name,
    t.table_name
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN 
    information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN 
    information_schema.tables AS t 
    ON tc.table_name = t.table_name
WHERE 
    t.table_name = 'YourTableName'
    AND kcu.column_name = 'YourColumnName';
	
3. Find Foreign Key Constraints Involving the Column
If the column is used as part of a foreign key, this query will display it:
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ForeignKey,
    c1.name AS ColumnName,
    t1.name AS TableName,
    t2.name AS ReferencedTable
FROM 
    sys.foreign_keys AS fk
JOIN 
    sys.foreign_key_columns AS fkc ON fk.object_id = fkc.constraint_object_id
JOIN 
    sys.tables AS t1 ON fkc.parent_object_id = t1.object_id
JOIN 
    sys.columns AS c1 ON fkc.parent_object_id = c1.object_id AND fkc.parent_column_id = c1.column_id
JOIN 
    sys.tables AS t2 ON fkc.referenced_object_id = t2.object_id
WHERE 
    t1.name = 'YourTableName'
    AND c1.name = 'YourColumnName';
