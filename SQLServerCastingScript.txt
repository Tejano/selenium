Use Query-Based Filtering Techniques
Rely on TRY_CAST or TRY_CONVERT functions in production to find any data that doesn’t conform to the DECIMAL(9,2) specification, helping to locate rows potentially causing the issue:

SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE TRY_CAST(YourDecimalColumn AS DECIMAL(9,2)) IS NULL
  AND YourDecimalColumn IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE TRY_CONVERT(DECIMAL(9,2), YourDecimalColumn) IS NULL
  AND YourDecimalColumn IS NOT NULL;

Check for Floating-Point Precision Issues Sometimes, values that appear as 0.00 or other decimals might have 
minuscule floating-point differences due to rounding errors or storage anomalies. You can identify these by rounding values and comparing them directly:
SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE ROUND(YourDecimalColumn, 2) NOT IN (0.00, YourDecimalColumn)
  AND YourDecimalColumn IS NOT NULL;


Sometimes NULL-allowed columns may contain values that look like valid numbers but don’t align with standard representations,
such as very small negative values that round to zero or small positives that evade > 0.00 criteria. Identify them as follows:
SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE YourDecimalColumn < 0.0001 AND YourDecimalColumn > -0.0001
  AND YourDecimalColumn IS NOT NULL;



Identify Any Hidden Characters in the Data
Occasionally, hidden characters like whitespace or control characters may exist in the data,
 especially if it was imported from external sources. These might prevent correct comparisons even though they visually appear valid. Here’s how to check:
SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE LEN(LTRIM(RTRIM(YourDecimalColumn))) <> LEN(CAST(YourDecimalColumn AS VARCHAR));

Check for Floating-Point Precision Issues Sometimes, values that appear as 0.00 or other decimals might 
have minuscule floating-point differences due to rounding errors or storage anomalies.
You can identify these by rounding values and comparing them directly:
SELECT *
FROM YourTable
WHERE ROUND(YourDecimalColumn, 2) NOT IN (0.00, YourDecimalColumn)
  AND YourDecimalColumn IS NOT NULL;






1. Find Indexes on the Column
Use this query to find indexes that include your column:
SELECT 
    i.name AS IndexName,
    i.type_desc AS IndexType,
    c.name AS ColumnName,
    t.name AS TableName
FROM 
    sys.indexes i
JOIN 
    sys.index_columns ic ON i.object_id = ic.object_id AND i.index_id = ic.index_id
JOIN 
    sys.columns c ON ic.object_id = c.object_id AND ic.column_id = c.column_id
JOIN 
    sys.tables t ON i.object_id = t.object_id
WHERE 
    t.name = 'YourTableName'
    AND c.name = 'YourColumnName';

2. Find Constraints on the Column
To check if the column is part of any constraints (such as PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, or CHECK constraints), use the following:

SELECT 
    tc.constraint_type,
    kcu.column_name,
    tc.constraint_name,
    t.table_name
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN 
    information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN 
    information_schema.tables AS t 
    ON tc.table_name = t.table_name
WHERE 
    t.table_name = 'YourTableName'
    AND kcu.column_name = 'YourColumnName';
	
3. Find Foreign Key Constraints Involving the Column
If the column is used as part of a foreign key, this query will display it:
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ForeignKey,
    c1.name AS ColumnName,
    t1.name AS TableName,
    t2.name AS ReferencedTable
FROM 
    sys.foreign_keys AS fk
JOIN 
    sys.foreign_key_columns AS fkc ON fk.object_id = fkc.constraint_object_id
JOIN 
    sys.tables AS t1 ON fkc.parent_object_id = t1.object_id
JOIN 
    sys.columns AS c1 ON fkc.parent_object_id = c1.object_id AND fkc.parent_column_id = c1.column_id
JOIN 
    sys.tables AS t2 ON fkc.referenced_object_id = t2.object_id
WHERE 
    t1.name = 'YourTableName'
    AND c1.name = 'YourColumnName';
