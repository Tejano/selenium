Running the SSIS Package via DTExec in SQL Server
To run an SSIS package, you can use the Shell command to call the DTExec utility, which is used to run SSIS packages from the command line.

Sub RunSSISPackage()

    Dim SSISPackagePath As String
    Dim cmd As String
    Dim result As Integer

    ' Path to the SSIS package file (.dtsx)
    SSISPackagePath = "C:\Path\To\Your\SSISPackage.dtsx"
    
    ' Command to run the SSIS package using DTExec
    cmd = "DTExec /F """ & SSISPackagePath & """"
    
    ' Execute the SSIS package
    result = Shell(cmd, vbNormalFocus)
    
    If result > 0 Then
        MsgBox "SSIS package executed successfully."
    Else
        MsgBox "Error executing SSIS package."
    End If

End Sub

1. Run the SSIS Package Using SQL Server Agent
Step 1: Open SQL Server Agent in SSMS.
Step 2: Create a new job and add a job step of type SQL Server Integration Services Package.
Step 3: Configure the job step to specify the SSIS package location (e.g., File System, SQL Server, SSISDB).
Step 4: Save the job and run it directly from SQL Server Agent in SSMS.
This method allows you to schedule or run the SSIS package on demand.
Sub ExecutePassThroughQuery()

    ' Execute the pass-through query to drop and recreate the table
    DoCmd.OpenQuery "qpt_DropAndRecreateTable"
    
    MsgBox "Table dropped and recreated successfully."

End Sub

Sub RefreshLinkedTable()

    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim connectString As String
    
    ' Set the name of the table to relink (adjust this accordingly)
    tableName = "YourLinkedTableName"
    
    ' Get a reference to the current database
    Set db = CurrentDb
    
    ' Get the table definition of the linked table
    Set tdf = db.TableDefs(tableName)
    
    ' Store the existing connection string (used for re-linking)
    connectString = tdf.Connect
    
    ' Refresh the link by re-assigning the connection string and calling RefreshLink
    tdf.Connect = connectString
    tdf.RefreshLink
    
    MsgBox "Linked table '" & tableName & "' has been refreshed."

    ' Clean up
    Set tdf = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing

End Sub

    Dim db As DAO.Database

    ' Reference the pass-through query
    Set qdf = db.QueryDefs("qpt_DropAndRecreateTable")

    ' Execute the pass-through query
    qdf.Execute dbFailOnError

    MsgBox "Table dropped and recreated successfully."

    ' Clean up
    Set qdf = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
