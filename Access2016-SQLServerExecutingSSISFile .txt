Running the SSIS Package via DTExec in SQL Server
To run an SSIS package, you can use the Shell command to call the DTExec utility, which is used to run SSIS packages from the command line.

Sub RunSSISPackage()

    Dim SSISPackagePath As String
    Dim cmd As String
    Dim result As Integer

    ' Path to the SSIS package file (.dtsx)
    SSISPackagePath = "C:\Path\To\Your\SSISPackage.dtsx"
    
    ' Command to run the SSIS package using DTExec
    cmd = "DTExec /F """ & SSISPackagePath & """"
    
    ' Execute the SSIS package
    result = Shell(cmd, vbNormalFocus)
    
    If result > 0 Then
        MsgBox "SSIS package executed successfully."
    Else
        MsgBox "Error executing SSIS package."
    End If

End Sub


Sub ExecutePassThroughQuery()

    ' Execute the pass-through query to drop and recreate the table
    DoCmd.OpenQuery "qpt_DropAndRecreateTable"
    
    MsgBox "Table dropped and recreated successfully."

End Sub
