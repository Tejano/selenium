The Microsoft Excel Object Library and Microsoft Office Object Library, version 16.0, are the default libraries
included with Office 2016, Office 2019, and Office 365. These libraries should provide all the required objects, methods, and properties for integrating Excel with Access and interacting with sensitivity labels if the required features are supported by your organization's setup.

Hereâ€™s what to keep in mind when working with these references and troubleshooting issues with Sensitivity Labels in Access VBA:

1. Compatibility of Version 16.0 Libraries
Version 16.0 is backward-compatible with earlier versions of Office (e.g., Office 2013) and 
forward-compatible with Microsoft 365 (Office 365).

If your organization uses Microsoft 365, referencing version 16.0 libraries is still valid and 
should support all the latest features, including sensitivity labels.

2. Features of the Referenced Libraries
Microsoft Excel Object Library:

Enables interaction with Excel objects like Workbook, Worksheet, Range, etc.
Provides methods for automating Excel tasks (e.g., opening workbooks, editing cells).
Allows access to the SensitivityLabel object through the Workbook object.

Microsoft Office Object Library:

Provides access to Office-wide objects and enums, such as MsoAssignmentMethod.
Includes APIs for handling features like Sensitivity Labels, Ribbon customizations, and other cross-Office features.

3. Verifying Sensitivity Label API Availability
Even with the correct references, the Sensitivity Label API might not be available in Access VBA due to:

Policy Restrictions:

Your organization might restrict programmatic access to sensitivity labels in some Office apps, such as Access.
Licensing Issues:

Sensitivity Labels require a specific license tier (e.g., Microsoft 365 E5 or AIP Premium).
Environment Configuration:

Some features may only be enabled for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, but not Access.
Test in Excel:
You can test the SensitivityLabel object directly in Excel to confirm whether it's accessible in your environment.

Sub TestSensitivityLabelInExcel()
    Dim lblInfo As Office.LabelInfo
    Dim wb As Workbook

    Set wb = ThisWorkbook

    On Error Resume Next
    Set lblInfo = wb.SensitivityLabel.GetLabelInfo()
    If lblInfo Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "SensitivityLabel is not available or no label is applied."
    Else
        MsgBox "Label Name: " & lblInfo.Name & vbCrLf & "Label ID: " & lblInfo.LabelId
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub
