The Microsoft Excel Object Library and Microsoft Office Object Library, version 16.0, are the default libraries
included with Office 2016, Office 2019, and Office 365. These libraries should provide all the required objects, methods, and properties for integrating Excel with Access and interacting with sensitivity labels if the required features are supported by your organization's setup.

Here’s what to keep in mind when working with these references and troubleshooting issues with Sensitivity Labels in Access VBA:

1. Compatibility of Version 16.0 Libraries
Version 16.0 is backward-compatible with earlier versions of Office (e.g., Office 2013) and 
forward-compatible with Microsoft 365 (Office 365).

If your organization uses Microsoft 365, referencing version 16.0 libraries is still valid and 
should support all the latest features, including sensitivity labels.

2. Features of the Referenced Libraries
Microsoft Excel Object Library:

Enables interaction with Excel objects like Workbook, Worksheet, Range, etc.
Provides methods for automating Excel tasks (e.g., opening workbooks, editing cells).
Allows access to the SensitivityLabel object through the Workbook object.

Microsoft Office Object Library:

Provides access to Office-wide objects and enums, such as MsoAssignmentMethod.
Includes APIs for handling features like Sensitivity Labels, Ribbon customizations, and other cross-Office features.

3. Verifying Sensitivity Label API Availability
Even with the correct references, the Sensitivity Label API might not be available in Access VBA due to:

Policy Restrictions:

Your organization might restrict programmatic access to sensitivity labels in some Office apps, such as Access.
Licensing Issues:

Sensitivity Labels require a specific license tier (e.g., Microsoft 365 E5 or AIP Premium).
Environment Configuration:

Some features may only be enabled for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, but not Access.
Test in Excel:
You can test the SensitivityLabel object directly in Excel to confirm whether it's accessible in your environment.

Sub TestSensitivityLabelInExcel()
    Dim lblInfo As Office.LabelInfo
    Dim wb As Workbook

    Set wb = ThisWorkbook

    On Error Resume Next
    Set lblInfo = wb.SensitivityLabel.GetLabelInfo()
    If lblInfo Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "SensitivityLabel is not available or no label is applied."
    Else
        MsgBox "Label Name: " & lblInfo.Name & vbCrLf & "Label ID: " & lblInfo.LabelId
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub

Revised Example Code for Debugging
Here’s an updated version of the code with enhanced debugging to validate the label application:
Sub GenerateAndVerifyExcelWithMIP()
    Dim xlApp As Object
    Dim xlWorkbook As Object
    Dim xlWorksheet As Object
    Dim lblInfo As Object
    Dim filePath As String

    ' Initialize Excel application
    Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    xlApp.Visible = False

    ' Create a new workbook
    Set xlWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Add
    Set xlWorksheet = xlWorkbook.Worksheets(1)

    ' Add sample data to the worksheet
    xlWorksheet.Cells(1, 1).Value = "Sample Data"

    ' Apply a sensitivity label
    On Error Resume Next
    Set lblInfo = xlWorkbook.SensitivityLabel.CreateLabelInfo()
    If Not lblInfo Is Nothing Then
        lblInfo.LabelId = "Your-Label-GUID-Here" ' Replace with the GUID provided by IT
        lblInfo.SetLabel "Automated justification message"
        xlWorkbook.Save
        MsgBox "Label applied successfully!"
    Else
        MsgBox "Unable to set sensitivity label. Ensure the LabelId is correct.", vbCritical
        xlWorkbook.Close False
        xlApp.Quit
        Exit Sub
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0

    ' Save the workbook
    filePath = "C:\Path\To\GeneratedFile.xlsx"
    xlWorkbook.SaveAs filePath

    ' Verify label application
    Dim appliedLblInfo As Object
    Set appliedLblInfo = xlWorkbook.SensitivityLabel.GetLabelInfo()
    If Not appliedLblInfo Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "Label successfully applied: " & appliedLblInfo.Name
    Else
        MsgBox "Label not applied correctly.", vbCritical
    End If

    ' Cleanup
    xlWorkbook.Close False
    xlApp.Quit
    Set lblInfo = Nothing
    Set xlWorkbook = Nothing
    Set xlApp = Nothing
End Sub

Alternative Approach: Apply Labels Instead of Checking
If retrieving the label using GetLabelInfo is unsupported, you may still be able
 to apply a label programmatically using the SetLabel method.
 
 Sub ApplySensitivityLabel()
    Dim xlApp As Object
    Dim xlWorkbook As Object
    Dim lblInfo As Object

    ' Create Excel application
    Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    xlApp.Visible = False

    ' Create or open workbook
    Set xlWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Add

    ' Save the workbook to ensure APIs work
    xlWorkbook.SaveAs "C:\Path\To\GeneratedFile.xlsx"

    ' Apply sensitivity label
    On Error Resume Next
    Set lblInfo = xlWorkbook.SensitivityLabel.CreateLabelInfo()
    If Not lblInfo Is Nothing Then
        lblInfo.LabelId = "Your-Label-GUID-Here" ' Replace with valid GUID
        lblInfo.SetLabel "Automated justification"
        MsgBox "Label applied successfully!"
    Else
        MsgBox "Unable to apply sensitivity label. Ensure LabelId is valid.", vbCritical
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0

    ' Save and close
    xlWorkbook.Save
    xlWorkbook.Close False
    xlApp.Quit

    ' Cleanup
    Set lblInfo = Nothing
    Set xlWorkbook = Nothing
    Set xlApp = Nothing
End Sub
