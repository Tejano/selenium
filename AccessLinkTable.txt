When converting an ADP to an ACCDB, the way tables are linked to the SQL Server 
will change significantly. In an ADP, tables are directly connected to SQL Server.
In an ACCDB, you need to create linked tables that 
connect to SQL Server via ODBC. Here's how to handle the transition:

Steps to Update Linked Tables
Remove Existing Links (If Any):

Before creating new linked tables, remove any existing links to avoid conflicts.
Create Linked Tables with Dynamic Connection Strings:

Use a VBA script to create linked tables based on the environment-specific connection string.
Handle Linked Table Updates in Your VBA Script:

Incorporate the creation of linked tables into your conversion script.
Detailed Implementation

1. Configuration Table
Ensure you have a configuration table to store connection strings as described previously.

2. Function to Get Connection String
Use the function provided earlier to get the connection string based on the environment.

3. VBA Script to Link Tables
Here's a VBA script to remove existing linked tables and create new ones based on the 
dynamic connection string:

Sub RefreshLinkedTables(env As String)
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
    Dim connString As String
    Dim strTableName As String
    Dim strLinkedTableName As String
    Dim strConnect As String

    connString = GetConnectionString(env)
    If connString = "" Then Exit Sub ' Exit if no connection string is found

    Set db = CurrentDb()

    ' Remove existing linked tables
    For Each tdf In db.TableDefs
        If tdf.Attributes And dbAttachedODBC Then
            db.TableDefs.Delete tdf.Name
        End If
    Next tdf

    ' Create new linked tables
    For Each strTableName In Array("Table1", "Table2", "Table3") ' List your table names here
        strLinkedTableName = strTableName
        strConnect = "ODBC;" & connString & ";"

        Set tdf = db.CreateTableDef(strLinkedTableName)
        tdf.Connect = strConnect
        tdf.SourceTableName = strTableName
        db.TableDefs.Append tdf
    Next strTableName

    MsgBox "Linked tables refreshed!"
End Sub

Function GetConnectionString(env As String) As String
    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    Dim connString As String
    
    Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset("SELECT ConnectionString FROM tblConnectionConfig WHERE EnvironmentName = '" & env & "'")
    
    If Not rs.EOF Then
        connString = rs!ConnectionString
    Else
        MsgBox "No connection string found for environment: " & env, vbCritical
        connString = ""
    End If
    
    rs.Close
    Set rs = Nothing
    
    GetConnectionString = connString
End Function

4. Update Your Main Conversion Script
Include the RefreshLinkedTables call in your main conversion script:

Sub ConvertADPToACCDB(env As String)
    Call ImportObjectsFromADP
    Call UpdateConnectionStrings(env)
    Call UpdateSQLQueries
    Call RefreshLinkedTables(env)
    MsgBox "Conversion completed!"
End Sub

' Example of running the conversion for the QA environment
Call ConvertADPToACCDB("qa")

Running the Updated Conversion Script
When you run the ConvertADPToACCDB script with the appropriate environment parameter, it will:

1. Import objects from the ADP file.
2. Update the connection strings in your VBA code.
3. Update SQL queries if necessary.
4. Refresh the linked tables to use the new connection string.

Summary
By using the above scripts, you can dynamically update the linked tables based on 
the environment (dev, qa, uat, prod). This ensures that your Access database remains flexible
and can easily switch between different environments without manual reconfiguration
