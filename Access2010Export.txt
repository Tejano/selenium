To handle this programmatically, we will split the task into two main parts:

Exporting Objects from ADP using Access 2010:
This part involves exporting forms, reports, macros, and modules from the ADP file.
Importing Objects into ACCDB using Access 2016:
This part involves importing the previously exported objects into a new ACCDB file and linking SQL Server tables.
Given the limitations, it is best to perform the export part from Access 2010 where ADP is still supported and then switch to Access 2016 for the import and linking steps.

Step-by-Step Programmatic Approach
Step 1: Export Objects from ADP (Access 2010)
Use Access 2010 to export forms, reports, macros, and modules programmatically.
Sub ExportObjectsFromADP()
    Dim obj As AccessObject
    Dim objType As Integer
    Dim exportPath As String

    exportPath = "C:\ExportedObjects\" ' Ensure this directory exists

    ' Export forms
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllForms
        Application.SaveAsText acForm, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export reports
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllReports
        Application.SaveAsText acReport, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export macros
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllMacros
        Application.SaveAsText acMacro, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export modules
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllModules
        Application.SaveAsText acModule, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export queries
    ExportQueriesFromADP

    MsgBox "Export completed!"
End Sub

Sub ExportQueriesFromADP()
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim exportPath As String
    Dim fileNum As Integer
    Dim filePath As String

    exportPath = "C:\ExportedObjects\Queries\" ' Ensure this directory exists
    Set db = CurrentDb

    ' Export each query's SQL definition to a text file
    For Each qdf In db.QueryDefs
        If Left(qdf.Name, 4) <> "~sq_" Then ' Exclude system and temporary queries
            filePath = exportPath & qdf.Name & ".sql"
            fileNum = FreeFile
            Open filePath For Output As #fileNum
            Print #fileNum, qdf.SQL
            Close #fileNum
        End If
    Next qdf

    MsgBox "Query export completed!"
End Sub

Open Access 2010 and create a new module.
Run the ExportObjectsFromADP subroutine to export all objects to text files.
