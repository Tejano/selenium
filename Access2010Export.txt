To handle this programmatically, we will split the task into two main parts:

Exporting Objects from ADP using Access 2010:
This part involves exporting forms, reports, macros, and modules from the ADP file.
Importing Objects into ACCDB using Access 2016:
This part involves importing the previously exported objects into a new ACCDB file and linking SQL Server tables.
Given the limitations, it is best to perform the export part from Access 2010 where ADP is still supported and then switch to Access 2016 for the import and linking steps.

Step-by-Step Programmatic Approach
Step 1: Export Objects from ADP (Access 2010)
Use Access 2010 to export forms, reports, macros, and modules programmatically.
Sub ExportObjectsFromADP()
    Dim obj As AccessObject
    Dim objType As Integer
    Dim exportPath As String

    exportPath = "C:\ExportedObjects\" ' Ensure this directory exists

    ' Export forms
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllForms
        DoCmd.SaveAsText acForm, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export reports
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllReports
        DoCmd.SaveAsText acReport, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export macros
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllMacros
        DoCmd.SaveAsText acMacro, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    ' Export modules
    For Each obj In CurrentProject.AllModules
        DoCmd.SaveAsText acModule, obj.Name, exportPath & obj.Name & ".txt"
    Next obj

    MsgBox "Export completed!"
End Sub
Open Access 2010 and create a new module.
Run the ExportObjectsFromADP subroutine to export all objects to text files.
