Verify the Connection String: Ensure the connection string is correct and that the SQL Server is accessible.
Check the Table Name Handling: Ensure that the table names are being processed correctly without unnecessary characters or formatting issues.
Simplify the Process: Create a direct subroutine to link a single table for debugging.
Simplified Debugging Subroutine
First, let's create a simplified subroutine to attempt to link a single table, dbo.Broker, and log any errors encountered.

Sub TestLinkSingleTable()
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
    Dim connString As String
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim logFilePath As String
    Dim fileNum As Integer

    ' Connection string with Windows Authentication
    connString = "ODBC;Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=YourServerName;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"
    logFilePath = "C:\ExportedObjects\LinkErrors.log"
    tableName = "dbo.Broker"

    ' Create or clear the log file
    Open logFilePath For Output As #1
    Print #1, "Log started at " & Now
    Close #1

    ' Open the current database
    Set db = CurrentDb()

    ' Attempt to link the table
    On Error GoTo LinkError
    ' Delete existing table link if it exists
    On Error Resume Next
    db.TableDefs.Delete tableName
    On Error GoTo 0

    ' Create new table link
    Set tdf = db.CreateTableDef(tableName)
    tdf.Connect = connString
    tdf.SourceTableName = tableName
    db.TableDefs.Append tdf
    MsgBox "Table linked successfully!"
    Exit Sub

LinkError:
    ' Log the error to the file
    fileNum = FreeFile
    Open logFilePath For Append As #fileNum
    Print #fileNum, "Failed to link table: " & tableName & " - Error Number: " & Err.Number & " - Description: " & Err.Description
    Close #fileNum
    MsgBox "Failed to link table. Check log for details."
    Err.Clear
End Sub


Steps to Execute
Run the TestLinkSingleTable Subroutine:
This will attempt to link the dbo.Broker table and log any errors encountered to LinkErrors.log.
Further Debugging
If the simplified subroutine still fails to link the table, consider these additional checks:

Verify SQL Server Accessibility:

Ensure that you can connect to the SQL Server and access the dbo.Broker table using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Check SQL Server Permissions:

Verify that the Windows account running Access has the necessary permissions to read the dbo.Broker table in SQL Server.
Test Connection String Independently:

Create a UDL file to test the connection string independently of Access:
Create a new text file and change its extension to .udl.
Double-click the UDL file to open the Data Link Properties window.
Configure the connection settings and test the connection.
Check ODBC Driver Installation:

Ensure that the ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server is installed on the machine running Access.
