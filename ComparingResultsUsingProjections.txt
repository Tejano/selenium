In a scenario where the data resides on different servers that cannot be interconnected, you will need to handle the data comparison in your Java application after fetching the data from each server separately. To optimize this process using projections and native queries, you can follow these steps:

1. Use Projections to Minimize Data Transfer
Since you cannot join data at the database level due to the separate servers, the first step is to minimize the amount of data transferred from each server. Use projections to fetch only the necessary fields from each database.

2. Write Native Queries for Each Server
Create native queries in your repositories that fetch data from each server. These queries should be optimized to retrieve only the data necessary for comparison.

java
// Repository for Server 2016
public interface Server2016Repository extends JpaRepository<Your2016Entity, Long> {
    @Query(value = "SELECT field1, field2, ... FROM your_table_2016", nativeQuery = true)
    List<Your2016Projection> findAllData();
}

// Repository for Server 2019
public interface Server2019Repository extends JpaRepository<Your2019Entity, Long> {
    @Query(value = "SELECT field1, field2, ... FROM your_table_2019", nativeQuery = true)
    List<Your2019Projection> findAllData();
}
3. Define Projection Interfaces
Define projection interfaces for each server's data. Ensure that the
 fields in these projections correspond to the fields you need for the comparison.
 
// Projection interface for 2016 data
public interface Your2016Projection {
    // Define getters for fields
}

// Projection interface for 2019 data
public interface Your2019Projection {
    // Define getters for fields
}

 4. Fetch Data in Service Layer
In your service layer, use the repository methods to fetch data from each server.
@Service
public class ComparisonService {

    @Autowired
    private Server2016Repository server2016Repository;
    
    @Autowired
    private Server2019Repository server2019Repository;

    public void compareData() {
        List<Your2016Projection> data2016 = server2016Repository.findAllData();
        List<Your2019Projection> data2019 = server2019Repository.findAllData();

        // Perform comparison logic here
    }
}

5. Implement the Comparison Logic
Implement the logic to compare the data from the two sets in Java. This might involve converting 
the projection data into a suitable format (like a Set or Map) for efficient comparison.

public void compareData() {
    // Fetch data
    List<Your2016Projection> data2016 = server2016Repository.findAllData();
    List<Your2019Projection> data2019 = server2019Repository.findAllData();

    // Convert to a suitable format for comparison
    Set<YourDataType> set2016 = convertToSet(data2016);
    Set<YourDataType> set2019 = convertToSet(data2019);

    // Find differences
    Set<YourDataType> uniqueIn2016 = new HashSet<>(set2016);
    uniqueIn2016.removeAll(set2019);

    Set<YourDataType> uniqueIn2019 = new HashSet<>(set2019);
    uniqueIn2019.removeAll(set2016);

    // Process the differences
    // ...
}
6. Write Results to Excel
Use a library like Apache POI to write the comparison results to an Excel file.

Additional Considerations
Efficiency: Ensure your comparison logic in Java is as efficient as possible, especially if you're dealing with large datasets.
Memory Management: Be mindful of memory usage. Large datasets can lead to OutOfMemory errors.
Parallel Processing: Consider using parallel streams or other concurrency mechanisms if the dataset is very large and the operation is CPU-intensive.
Caching: If the data doesn't change frequently and the operation is performed multiple times, consider caching the results.
By using projections, you reduce the amount of data transferred over the network, 
which can help decrease the overall processing time. However, since the comparison is done in the Java application, 
the performance will largely depend on the efficiency of your comparison logic and the resources available to your application.


The convertToSet method in the example is a hypothetical function you would implement to convert the list of projection 
objects into a Set of a more suitable data type for comparison. This conversion is important for efficient comparison of the datasets.

The Set data structure is chosen because it provides fast operations for checking the presence of an element, 
which is useful in finding unique or differing elements between two datasets. The conversion process typically 
involves iterating over the list of projection objects and transforming each object into a more comparable form, 
often a custom data type or a simpler structure like a string or a tuple.

Hereâ€™s an example of what the convertToSet method might look like:

Define a Comparable DataType
First, define a data type that includes the fields you'll use for comparison. This type should override equals and hashCode to ensure correct behavior in a Set.

public class ComparableData {
    private String field1;
    private String field2;
    // other fields

    // Constructor, getters, setters

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        ComparableData that = (ComparableData) o;
        return Objects.equals(field1, that.field1) &&
               Objects.equals(field2, that.field2);
        // include other fields in comparison
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(field1, field2); // include other fields in hash
    }
}

Implement the Conversion Method
Then, implement the convertToSet method that takes a list of projection objects and converts them into a Set of ComparableData.
public Set<ComparableData> convertToSet(List<YourProjectionType> projectionList) {
    Set<ComparableData> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
    for (YourProjectionType item : projectionList) {
        ComparableData data = new ComparableData();
        data.setField1(item.getField1());
        data.setField2(item.getField2());
        // set other fields

        resultSet.add(data);
    }
    return resultSet;
}
In this implementation:

YourProjectionType would be Your2016Projection or Your2019Projection, depending on which dataset you're converting.
The convertToSet method iterates over each item in the projection list, creates a new ComparableData object, sets its fields, and adds it to the resulting Set.
By using a Set of ComparableData, you can efficiently perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference to find unique and differing records.
This method helps streamline the comparison process by converting the projections into a format 
that's more conducive to comparison operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Yes, YourDataType can be a DTO (Data Transfer Object). In fact, using a DTO for this purpose is
quite common and appropriate in many cases. A DTO is a simple, flat data structure used to 
transfer data between software application subsystems. It's often used to aggregate 
and encapsulate data for transfer, particularly in scenarios like the one you're dealing with, 
where data needs to be compared or transformed.

When using a DTO as YourDataType for comparison purposes, there are a few key considerations:

Data Fields: Ensure that the DTO contains all the fields you need for the comparison.
These fields should correspond to the data you're interested in comparing between the 2016 and 2019 datasets.

equals and hashCode Methods: Override the equals and hashCode methods in the DTO. 
These methods are crucial for accurate comparison and proper functioning in a Set. 
The equals method should define how two instances of the DTO are considered equal, 
typically by comparing each relevant field. The hashCode method should provide a consistent hash code calculation based on the same fields.

No Business Logic: DTOs should be kept simple and not contain business logic. 
They are meant to be plain data carriers. The logic for comparison or other operations should be in the service layer or another appropriate layer of your application.

Performance Considerations: When using DTOs in operations involving large datasets, 
be mindful of memory usage and performance. DTOs should be as lightweight as possible, containing only the necessary data.

Here's a brief example of how you might structure your DTO:

public class YourDto {
    private String field1;
    private String field2;
    // Other fields necessary for comparison

    public YourDto(String field1, String field2) {
        this.field1 = field1;
        this.field2 = field2;
        // Set other fields
    }

    // Getters, setters

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        YourDto that = (YourDto) o;
        return Objects.equals(field1, that.field1) &&
               Objects.equals(field2, that.field2);
        // Include other fields in comparison
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(field1, field2); // Include other fields in hash
    }
}
And when converting from your projections to DTOs:

public Set<YourDto> convertToDtoSet(List<YourProjectionType> projectionList) {
    Set<YourDto> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
    for (YourProjectionType item : projectionList) {
        YourDto dto = new YourDto(item.getField1(), item.getField2());
        // set other fields
        resultSet.add(dto);
    }
    return resultSet;
}
Using DTOs in this manner can help streamline your data handling and make the comparison process more efficient and manageable.

2. Using ModelMapper
ModelMapper is a library that simplifies the process of mapping between 
different data models in Java. It uses conventions to automatically map values from one object to another.

First, add ModelMapper to your project's dependencies. Then, you can use it as follows:
import org.modelmapper.ModelMapper;

public class YourService {

    private final ModelMapper modelMapper = new ModelMapper();

    public Set<YourDto> convertToDtoSet(List<YourProjectionType> projectionList) {
        Set<YourDto> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (YourProjectionType item : projectionList) {
            YourDto dto = modelMapper.map(item, YourDto.class);
            resultSet.add(dto);
        }
        return resultSet;
    }
}

3. Using MapStruct
MapStruct is another popular Java library used for object mapping. It's a compile-time code generator, which means it's very efficient at runtime.

First, you need to define a mapper interface:
import org.mapstruct.Mapper;
import org.mapstruct.factory.Mappers;

@Mapper
public interface YourMapper {
    YourMapper INSTANCE = Mappers.getMapper(YourMapper.class);

    YourDto projectionToDto(YourProjectionType projection);
}

Then use this mapper in your service:

public Set<YourDto> convertToDtoSet(List<YourProjectionType> projectionList) {
    Set<YourDto> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
    for (YourProjectionType item : projectionList) {
        YourDto dto = YourMapper.INSTANCE.projectionToDto(item);
        resultSet.add(dto);
    }
    return resultSet;
}

Choosing a Method
Manual Mapping is simple and requires no additional dependencies, but can become cumbersome for complex objects.
ModelMapper is great for quick, convention-based mapping but might need additional configuration for complex scenarios.
MapStruct offers compile-time safety and efficiency but requires an additional build-time dependency and configuration.
Using a mapper can greatly simplify your code and reduce boilerplate, especially when dealing with many fields or complex nested structures.
