Create a Method to Execute the Query:

First, create a method in your service or repository that will execute the query. 
In this method, you can specify which data source (2016 or 2019) to use based on your requirements.

@Service
public class BCCService {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("brokerOldVersionDataSource")
    private DataSource dataSourceOld;

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("brokerNewVersionDataSource")
    private DataSource dataSourceNew;

    public List<Object[]> executeQuery(String yearMonth, String dataVersion) {
        DataSource dataSource;
        if ("2016".equals(dataVersion)) {
            dataSource = dataSourceOld;
        } else if ("2019".equals(dataVersion)) {
            dataSource = dataSourceNew;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid data version specified.");
        }

        // Create a JdbcTemplate using the selected data source
        JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);

        // Define the SQL query
        String sql = "SELECT pricinglevel, carrier, SUM(mem), SUM(sub) " +
                     "FROM BrokerCalculationClaims " +
                     "WHERE yearMonth = ? " +
                     "GROUP BY pricinglevel, carrier";

        // Execute the query
        return jdbcTemplate.query(sql, new Object[]{yearMonth}, new BeanPropertyRowMapper(Object[].class));
    }
}
Run the Query:

In your service layer, you can call this executeQuery method with the appropriate data version (2016 or 2019)
 and the desired yearMonth. This method will run the query using the selected data source.
 
 @Service
public class BCCService {

    // ... (previous code)

    public List<Object[]> executeQueryForDataVersion(String yearMonth, String dataVersion) {
        return executeQuery(yearMonth, dataVersion);
    }
}

Service Layer Usage:

You can use the executeQueryForDataVersion method to execute the query against either the 2016 or 2019 data source, based on the specified data version:

@Service
public class BCCService {

    // ... (previous code)

    public void processQuery() {
        String yearMonth = "202310";
        String dataVersion2016 = "2016";
        String dataVersion2019 = "2019";

        List<Object[]> result2016 = executeQueryForDataVersion(yearMonth, dataVersion2016);
        List<Object[]> result2019 = executeQueryForDataVersion(yearMonth, dataVersion2019);

        // Process and compare the results from both data sources as needed.
    }
}
This approach allows you to execute the same query against different data sources (2016 and 2019) 
based on the specified data version, and then process and compare the results accordingly.


Yes, the technique I described uses JdbcTemplate and SQL queries to directly interact with the database instead of relying on JPA entities. It is suitable when you need to work with multiple data sources or when you want more control over your SQL queries.

JdbcTemplate is part of the Spring Framework and provides a way to interact with databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) without needing to create and manage low-level JDBC connections, statements, and result sets manually. Here's an explanation of the usage of jdbcTemplate.query:

jdbcTemplate Object Creation:
In your code, you create a JdbcTemplate object using the selected DataSource. The DataSource represents the connection to the specific database (in this case, either SQL Server 2016 or SQL Server 2019).

java
Copy code
JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
SQL Query Definition:
You define your SQL query as a string. This query can be parameterized, which allows you to inject values into the query dynamically. In your example, the SQL query is used to retrieve data from the BrokerCalculationClaims table for a specific yearMonth.

Parameterized Query Execution:
You use the jdbcTemplate.query method to execute the SQL query. This method takes the following parameters:

The SQL query as a string.
An array of objects representing the parameters in the SQL query.
A RowMapper to map the result set rows to Java objects.
In this case, the query is parameterized with the yearMonth, so you pass it as an object in the array of parameters.
The BeanPropertyRowMapper(Object[].class) is used to map the result set rows to an array of objects, where each element in the array corresponds to a column in the result set.

Query Execution Result:
The jdbcTemplate.query method returns a list of objects where each object represents a row in the result set. 
The type of object returned depends on the RowMapper specified. In your case, it's an array of objects.

Processing and Usage:
After executing the query, you can process and use the results as needed in your application logic.

The usage of JdbcTemplate is particularly useful when you need to perform custom or complex queries, interact with multiple databases, or have more fine-grained control over your database operations. 
It is a lower-level approach compared to JPA and Hibernate and is typically used in situations where raw SQL is preferred or necessary.


If you want to perform operations on both data sources within the same service or repository, you'll need to manage the transactions and database connections manually. Here's how you can work with multiple data sources within the same service or repository using EntityManager and DataSource:

Define Multiple Entity Managers and Data Sources:
In your configuration classes, define multiple EntityManager and DataSource beans for 
each data source. You can use the @Qualifier annotation to distinguish between them.
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class BrokerDataSourceConfig {

    @Primary
    @Bean(name = "entityManagerOld")
    public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactoryOld(
        EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder,
        @Qualifier("brokerOldVersionDataSource") DataSource dataSource
    ) {
        return builder
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .packages("com.example.entity")
            .persistenceUnit("old")
            .build();
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean(name = "brokerOldVersionDataSource")
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource")
    public DataSource dataSourceOld() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }

    @Bean(name = "entityManagerNew")
    public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactoryNew(
        EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder,
        @Qualifier("brokerNewVersionDataSource") DataSource dataSource
    ) {
        return builder
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .packages("com.example.entity")
            .persistenceUnit("new")
            .build();
    }

    @Bean(name = "brokerNewVersionDataSource")
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.second-datasource")
    public DataSource dataSourceNew() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }
}


In your service or repository class, you can inject both EntityManager 
and DataSource for different data sources using @PersistenceContext and @Qualifier annotations.

@Service
public class BCCService {
    @PersistenceContext(unitName = "old")
    @Qualifier("entityManagerOld")
    private EntityManager entityManagerOld;
    
    @PersistenceContext(unitName = "new")
    @Qualifier("entityManagerNew")
    private EntityManager entityManagerNew;
    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("brokerOldVersionDataSource")
    private DataSource dataSourceOld;
    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("brokerNewVersionDataSource")
    private DataSource dataSourceNew;
    
    @Autowired
    private BCCRepository bccRepository;
    
    public void performOperations() {
        // Use entityManagerOld and dataSourceOld to perform operations on the old data source.
        // Use entityManagerNew and dataSourceNew to perform operations on the new data source.
    }
}

In this setup, you have access to both EntityManager and DataSource for both data sources. 
When you want to perform operations on a specific data source, you can use the corresponding EntityManager and DataSource based on your requirements.

Remember that with this approach, you'll need to manage transactions manually. 
You can use @Transactional annotations on your methods to define transaction boundaries and specify which EntityManager and DataSource to use within those transactions.



The error you're encountering, "failed to instantiate: [Ljava.lang.Object]: no default constructor found," indicates that Spring is trying to instantiate an array of Object, but it cannot find a default constructor for it.

This error is occurring because the result of your query is a list of arrays of Object, and Spring is trying to create an array of Object using reflection, but arrays don't have constructors that you can call.

To resolve this issue, you should create a class to represent the result of your query, and Spring will be able to instantiate objects of that class. Here's what you can do:

Create a Result Class:

Define a class to represent the result of your query. This class should have fields corresponding to the columns returned by your query.

public class QueryResult {
    private String pricinglevel;
    private String carrier;
    private Long sumMem;
    private Long sumSub;

    public QueryResult(String pricinglevel, String carrier, Long sumMem, Long sumSub) {
        this.pricinglevel = pricinglevel;
        this.carrier = carrier;
        this.sumMem = sumMem;
        this.sumSub = sumSub;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
Modify Your Query Method:

Modify your query method to use the RowMapper to map the result set to instances of the QueryResult class:
public List<QueryResult> executeQuery(String yearMonth, String dataVersion) {
    DataSource dataSource;
    if ("2016".equals(dataVersion)) {
        dataSource = dataSourceOld;
    } else if ("2019".equals(dataVersion)) {
        dataSource = dataSourceNew;
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid data version specified.");
    }

    JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);

    String sql = "SELECT pricinglevel, carrier, SUM(mem), SUM(sub) " +
                 "FROM BrokerCalculationClaims " +
                 "WHERE yearMonth = ? " +
                 "GROUP BY pricinglevel, carrier";

    return jdbcTemplate.query(
        sql,
        new Object[]{yearMonth},
        (rs, rowNum) -> new QueryResult(
            rs.getString("pricinglevel"),
            rs.getString("carrier"),
            rs.getLong("SUM(mem)"),
            rs.getLong("SUM(sub)")
        )
    );
}
Update Your processQuery Method:

In your processQuery method, you should update it to work with the QueryResult class:

public void processQuery() {
    String yearMonth = "202310";
    String dataVersion2016 = "2016";
    String dataVersion2019 = "2019";

    List<QueryResult> result2016 = executeQuery(yearMonth, dataVersion2016);
    List<QueryResult> result2019 = executeQuery(yearMonth, dataVersion2019);

    // Process and compare the results from both data sources as needed.
}
By creating a dedicated result class and updating your query method accordingly, 
you'll be able to work with the results of your query more effectively and avoid the "no default constructor found" error


To verify that the data in the objects from the 2016 and 2019 data sources match and identify non-matching records, you can follow these steps:

Compare Data:
First, compare the data from both sources, which in your case are the List<QueryResult> objects for 2016 and 2019. You can iterate through both lists and compare each QueryResult object to check for differences.

Identify Non-Matching Records:
When you find differences between corresponding records, create a list to store the non-matching records. You can use a List<QueryResult> to keep track of these records.

Comparison Logic:
The specific comparison logic depends on your use case and what you consider to be a "match." It might involve comparing values of specific fields (e.g., pricinglevel, carrier, sumMem, and sumSub) or using a combination of fields to determine a match.

Here's a simplified example of how you can perform the comparison and identify non-matching records:

List<QueryResult> nonMatchingRecords = new ArrayList<>();

for (QueryResult result2016 : result2016) {
    // Find the corresponding record in result2019 based on a common identifier (e.g., pricinglevel and carrier).
    QueryResult correspondingResult2019 = result2019.stream()
        .filter(r -> r.getPricinglevel().equals(result2016.getPricinglevel()) && r.getCarrier().equals(result2016.getCarrier()))
        .findFirst()
        .orElse(null);

    // Compare the fields to check for non-matching records.
    if (correspondingResult2019 != null) {
        if (!result2016.equals(correspondingResult2019)) {
            nonMatchingRecords.add(result2016);
        }
    } else {
        // Handle the case where a corresponding record is not found in result2019.
        nonMatchingRecords.add(result2016);
    }
}

// If you also want to identify records present in result2019 but not in result2016, you can perform a similar comparison in the opposite direction.

// nonMatchingRecords now contains records that don't match between 2016 and 2019.

Reporting or Logging:
Depending on your needs, you can report or log the non-matching records for further analysis or troubleshooting. You might want to log them, write them to a file, or send them as a notification.

This approach allows you to identify non-matching records by comparing objects and applying custom comparison logic based on your data and business rules. You can adjust the comparison logic as needed to match your specific requirements.
