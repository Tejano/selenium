To convert a 2010 ADP (Access Data Project) Access database to Access 2016, follow these steps:

Backup Your Database:

Always start by making a backup of your original 2010 ADP file to avoid any potential data loss during the conversion process.
Convert ADP to ACCDB:

Since Access 2013 and later versions do not support ADP files, you need to convert your ADP file to an ACCDB file format. This involves importing the objects 
from the ADP into a new ACCDB database.
Create a New Blank Database:

Open Access 2016 and create a new blank database in the ACCDB format.
Import Database Objects:

Use the import functionality in Access 2016 to import all tables, queries, forms, reports, 
macros, and modules from your ADP file. To do this:
Click on the External Data tab.
Select Access from the Import & Link group.
In the Get External Data - Access Database dialog box, browse to your ADP file and select it.
Choose the option to import the source data into the current database and follow the prompts to import all objects.
Recreate Connections:

ADP files are directly connected to SQL Server databases, whereas ACCDB files use linked tables 
for SQL Server connections. You will need to recreate the connection to your SQL Server:
Go to the External Data tab.
Select ODBC Database from the Import & Link group.
Choose the option to link to the data source by creating a linked table.
Follow the prompts to set up a new ODBC data source to your SQL Server and link the tables.
Update Queries and Code:

Review and update any queries, forms, reports, macros, and VBA code that may reference the old 
ADP connection objects to ensure they work with the new linked tables.
Test Thoroughly:

After completing the conversion, thoroughly test your new Access 2016 ACCDB database to ensure that 
all functionality works as expected.
By following these steps, you can successfully convert a 2010 ADP Access database to Access 2016, 
allowing you to leverage the new features and capabilities of the updated Access version.
