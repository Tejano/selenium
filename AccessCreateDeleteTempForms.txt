Step 1: Create the Temporary Form
This code snippet dynamically creates a temporary form and assigns a passthrough query as its record source:

Sub CreateTempFormWithUnloadEvent()
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim frm As Access.Form
    Dim mdl As Module
    Dim tempQueryName As String
    Dim tempFormName As String

    Set db = CurrentDb

    ' Create a unique name for the passthrough query and temp form
    tempQueryName = "ptqTempQuery_" & Format(Now(), "yyyymmdd_hhnnss")
    tempFormName = "frmTemp_" & Format(Now(), "yyyymmdd_hhnnss")

    ' Create the passthrough query
    Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef(tempQueryName)
    qdf.Connect = "ODBC;DSN=YourDSNName;" ' Adjust your connection string as needed
    qdf.SQL = "EXEC YourStoredProcedureName" ' Adjust to your stored procedure
    qdf.ReturnsRecords = True
    qdf.Close

    ' Create the temporary form
    Set frm = CreateForm
    frm.RecordSource = tempQueryName

    ' Set form properties
    frm.Caption = "Temporary Form"
    frm.Name = tempFormName

    ' Save the form so it can be referenced later
    DoCmd.Save acForm, frm.Name

    ' Open the form in Form View
    DoCmd.OpenForm frm.Name, acFormDS

    ' Get the module of the form
    Set mdl = Forms(tempFormName).Module

    ' Insert the Form_Unload event handler into the form's module
    With mdl
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    Dim db As DAO.Database"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    On Error Resume Next"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    Set db = CurrentDb"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    ' Delete the temporary query"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    db.QueryDefs.Delete Me.RecordSource"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    ' Delete the temporary form"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    DoCmd.DeleteObject acForm, Me.Name"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    ' Cleanup"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "    Set db = Nothing"
        .InsertLines .CountOfLines + 1, "End Sub"
    End With

    ' Cleanup
    Set frm = Nothing
    Set qdf = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
    Set mdl = Nothing
End Sub

Explanation:
Create the Passthrough Query: A unique name is generated for the passthrough query,
 which is then created with the necessary connection string and SQL command.

Create the Temporary Form: The form is created with a unique name and the passthrough 
query is set as its record source.

Insert the Form_Unload Code: The code dynamically inserts the Form_Unload event handler
 into the temporary formâ€™s module. This handler deletes the passthrough query and the temporary form when the form is closed.

Cleanup: After the form is created and the event handler is inserted, the code cleans
 up by setting all the objects to Nothing.

This code allows you to create a temporary form that cleans up after itself by
 deleting the associated passthrough query and the form itself when it is closed.
