This error typically indicates that there's a misconfiguration in your Spring Security setup, specifically related to URL patterns. In a local environment, certain properties might be set differently compared to a production environment like PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry).

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check Configuration Files
Ensure that your application.yml or application.properties files have the correct configurations for both local and PCF environments. Look for any differences in the security configuration.

2. Verify URL Patterns
Ensure that URL patterns in your Spring Security configuration are not null or empty. Check your security configuration class for any URL patterns that might be incorrectly defined.

Example of a correct security configuration:
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .formLogin().loginPage("/login").permitAll()
            .and()
            .logout().permitAll();
    }
}

3. Environment-Specific Profiles
Make sure you are using the correct Spring profiles for local and PCF environments. You can specify profiles in your application.yml:

spring:
  profiles:
    active: local
---
spring:
  profiles: pcf
  security:
    # your PCF-specific security configurations














4. Logging and Debugging
Enable detailed logging to get more information about the error. You can add the following to your application.yml or application.properties:


logging.level.org.springframework.security=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG




5. PCF Configuration
Check your PCF environment configurations. Ensure that environment variables and services (like databases, config servers) are properly set up.

6. Check Dependencies
Ensure all your dependencies are properly included and there are no conflicts. Sometimes different environments can have different versions of dependencies which might cause such issues.

7. Review the Full Stack Trace
Examine the full stack trace of the error to get more insights. This might point you directly to the problematic part of your code or configuration.

Example Fix
If the issue is related to a missing or empty pattern, you might need to ensure all patterns are properly defined:
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()  // Ensure this pattern is not null or empty
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .formLogin().loginPage("/login").permitAll()
        .and()
        .logout().permitAll();
}
