1. Find All Dependencies for the Table

This query provides all objects that depend on the table dbo.TableName:

SELECT OBJECT_NAME(referencing_id) AS DependentObjectName, 
       OBJECT_NAME(referenced_id) AS ReferencedObjectName,
       is_ambiguous
FROM sys.sql_expression_dependencies
WHERE referenced_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.TableName');


--2. List Objects Where dbo.TableName Is Used
--This query checks all objects in the database for references to dbo.TableName:

SELECT o.name AS ObjectName, o.type_desc AS ObjectType
FROM sys.objects o
INNER JOIN sys.sql_modules m ON o.object_id = m.object_id
WHERE m.definition LIKE '%dbo.TableName%';


--3. Find Objects Referencing Specific Columns
--Use sys.sql_modules to search for references to the specific columns:

SELECT o.name AS ObjectName,
       o.type_desc AS ObjectType,
       m.definition
FROM sys.objects o
INNER JOIN sys.sql_modules m ON o.object_id = m.object_id
WHERE m.definition LIKE '%YourColumnName%' -- Replace with the column name
  AND o.type IN ('P', 'V', 'FN', 'TR');    -- P = Stored Procedure, V = View, FN = Function, TR = Trigger
  
  
--4. Check for INSERT or UPDATE Operations
--Filter objects to find where the column is being inserted into or updated in other tables:

SELECT o.name AS ObjectName,
       o.type_desc AS ObjectType,
       m.definition
FROM sys.objects o
INNER JOIN sys.sql_modules m ON o.object_id = m.object_id
WHERE m.definition LIKE '%INSERT%'
  AND m.definition LIKE '%YourColumnName%'
  AND o.type = 'P'; -- Focus on stored procedures

--Step 5. Identify Target Tables for Alteration
--If the column is inserted into other tables, identify those tables using the following query:
SELECT DISTINCT 
       t.name AS TargetTable,
       SCHEMA_NAME(t.schema_id) AS TargetSchema,
       o.name AS ObjectName,
       o.type_desc AS ObjectType,
       m.definition AS ObjectDefinition
FROM sys.sql_modules m
INNER JOIN sys.objects o ON m.object_id = o.object_id
INNER JOIN sys.tables t ON m.definition LIKE '%[' + t.name + ']%'
WHERE m.definition LIKE '%INSERT%' 
  AND m.definition LIKE '%YourColumnName%'
  AND m.definition LIKE '%YourTableName%'
  AND o.type = 'P'; -- Focus on stored procedures
