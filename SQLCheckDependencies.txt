1. Find All Dependencies for the Table
This query provides all objects that depend on the table dbo.TableName:

SELECT OBJECT_NAME(referencing_id) AS DependentObjectName, 
       OBJECT_NAME(referenced_id) AS ReferencedObjectName,
       is_ambiguous
FROM sys.sql_expression_dependencies
WHERE referenced_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.TableName');

2. List Objects Where dbo.TableName Is Used
This query checks all objects in the database for references to dbo.TableName:
SELECT o.name AS ObjectName, o.type_desc AS ObjectType
FROM sys.objects o
INNER JOIN sys.sql_modules m ON o.object_id = m.object_id
WHERE m.definition LIKE '%dbo.TableName%';
