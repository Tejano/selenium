To check if a pass-through query exists in an Access 2016 database, and if it does, update it with a new SQL query (or create it if it doesn't exist), you can use the following VBA approach:

Step-by-Step Solution:
Check if the Query Exists:

You can check if the pass-through query exists by attempting to reference it in the QueryDefs collection.
Update the Query:

If the query exists, you update its SQL statement.
Create the Query:

If the query does not exist, you create a new pass-through query and set its SQL statement

Sub CreateOrUpdatePassThroughQuery(queryName As String, sqlQuery As String, odbcConnectionString As String)
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef

    Set db = CurrentDb

    ' Check if the pass-through query exists
    On Error Resume Next
    Set qdf = db.QueryDefs(queryName)
    On Error GoTo 0

    If Not qdf Is Nothing Then
        ' The query exists, update it
        qdf.SQL = sqlQuery
        qdf.Connect = odbcConnectionString
        qdf.ReturnsRecords = True  ' Adjust this as needed based on whether the query returns records
        qdf.Close
        MsgBox "Pass-through query '" & queryName & "' has been updated.", vbInformation
    Else
        ' The query does not exist, create it
        Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef(queryName)
        qdf.SQL = sqlQuery
        qdf.Connect = odbcConnectionString
        qdf.ReturnsRecords = True  ' Adjust this as needed
        MsgBox "Pass-through query '" & queryName & "' has been created.", vbInformation
    End If

    ' Clean up
    Set qdf = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
End Sub


How to Use This Code:
Parameters:

queryName: The name of the pass-through query you want to check, update, or create.
sqlQuery: The SQL string that you want to set as the query's SQL statement.
odbcConnectionString: The connection string used to connect to the SQL Server.
Execution:

Call the CreateOrUpdatePassThroughQuery subroutine with the appropriate parameters to check if the query exists and either update it or create it.
Example Call:

Sub TestCreateOrUpdate()
    Dim queryName As String
    Dim sqlQuery As String
    Dim odbcConnectionString As String

    queryName = "MyPassThroughQuery"
    sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE SomeCondition = 'Value'"
    odbcConnectionString = "ODBC;DSN=MyDSN;UID=myUsername;PWD=myPassword;"

    Call CreateOrUpdatePassThroughQuery(queryName, sqlQuery, odbcConnectionString)
End Sub
Explanation:
Check for Existence: The code uses On Error Resume Next to avoid an error if the query doesnâ€™t exist and then attempts to set the qdf object to the query definition. If the query does not exist, qdf will be Nothing.
Update Existing Query: If the query exists, the code updates its SQL property and connection string.
Create New Query: If the query does not exist, the code creates a new pass-through query using CreateQueryDef.
Summary:
This approach allows you to efficiently manage pass-through queries in Access 2016 by checking for their existence, updating them if they already exist, or creating them 
if they don't. This ensures that your database remains organized and that queries are always up-to-date with the latest SQL statements
