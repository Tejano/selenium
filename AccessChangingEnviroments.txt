To ensure that the linked tables in Access are refreshed to point to the different servers dynamically, you need to update the connection string for each linked table whenever the server environment is switched. Here's a more detailed step-by-step approach to accomplish this:

Step-by-Step Guide
Store Connection Strings and Initialization Logic:

Define the connection strings for each environment.
Write a subroutine to set the connection string based on the selected environment and refresh linked tables.
Create a Form for Environment Selection:

Use a form to select the environment.
Add a button to confirm the selection and initialize the connection.
Module: Define Connection Strings and Initialization Logic
Create a new module and add the following code:

Public Sub InitializeConnectionString(environment As String)
    Dim connString As String
    
    ' Define connection strings for each environment
    Select Case environment
        Case "DEV"
            connString = "ODBC;Driver={SQL Server};Server=DevServerName;Database=DevDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"
        Case "QA"
            connString = "ODBC;Driver={SQL Server};Server=QAServerName;Database=QADatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"
        Case "UAT"
            connString = "ODBC;Driver={SQL Server};Server=UATServerName;Database=UATDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"
        Case "PROD"
            connString = "ODBC;Driver={SQL Server};Server=ProdServerName;Database=ProdDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"
        Case Else
            MsgBox "Invalid environment specified.", vbCritical
            Exit Sub
    End Select
    
    ' Set the connection string for the current project
    CurrentProject.BaseConnectionString = connString
    
    ' Refresh linked tables to ensure they use the new connection string
    RefreshLinkedTables connString
    
    MsgBox "Connected to " & environment & " environment.", vbInformation
End Sub

Public Sub RefreshLinkedTables(connString As String)
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim tbl As DAO.TableDef
    
    Set db = CurrentDb
    
    ' Loop through all table definitions
    For Each tbl In db.TableDefs
        ' Check if the table is linked (i.e., it has a non-empty Connect string)
        If tbl.Connect <> "" Then
            ' Update the Connect string with the new connection string
            tbl.Connect = connString
            ' Refresh the link to ensure the table uses the new connection string
            tbl.RefreshLink
        End If
    Next tbl
    
    Set tbl = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
End Sub

Form: Environment Selection
Create a new form (e.g., frmSelectEnvironment) with the following controls:

Combo Box (cmbEnvironment):

Populate it with the values "DEV", "QA", "UAT", "PROD".
Command Button (btnSetEnvironment):

Set the caption to "Set Environment".
Form Code
Add the following code to the form's code module:

Private Sub btnSetEnvironment_Click()
    Dim selectedEnvironment As String
    
    ' Get the selected environment from the combo box
    selectedEnvironment = Me.cmbEnvironment.Value
    
    ' Call the initialization subroutine to set the connection string
    InitializeConnectionString selectedEnvironment
End Sub

Explanation
Define Connection Strings:

Use the Select Case statement to define the connection strings for each environment.
Set Connection String:

CurrentProject.BaseConnectionString = connString sets the connection string for the current project.
Refresh Linked Tables:

The RefreshLinkedTables subroutine loops through all table definitions, updates the Connect 
string with the new connection string, and calls RefreshLink to ensure the tables use the new connection string.
User Interface:

A form allows users to select the environment and dynamically switch the connection.
Additional Considerations
Environment Selection: Ensure the environment selection form is accessible and user-friendly.
Security: Secure the selection mechanism to prevent unauthorized changes.
Error Handling: Add appropriate error handling to manage cases where setting the connection string or refreshing links might fail.
By following these steps, you can dynamically switch between different environments in Access 2016, 
ensuring that your application correctly connects to the appropriate SQL Server instance and that all linked tables are updated accordingly.
