Steps:
Save the Current Record:

Use the DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSaveRecord to ensure that any changes made to the form fields are saved before executing the SP.
Execute the Stored Procedure:

Execute the SP as planned using a pass-through query or any other method you have set up.
Requery the Form:

After the SP is executed, requery the form to reflect the latest data.
Example Code:
Here’s how you can implement this in the button click event:

Private Sub btnExecuteSP_Click()
    ' Save the current record
    If Me.Dirty Then
        DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSaveRecord
    End If

    ' Execute the stored procedure
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef("")
    
    qdf.Connect = "ODBC;DSN=YourDSNName;UID=YourUsername;PWD=YourPassword;DATABASE=YourDatabase"
    qdf.SQL = "EXEC YourStoredProcedureName " & [Parameters if any]
    qdf.ReturnsRecords = False
    qdf.Execute dbFailOnError
    
    Set qdf = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing
    
    ' Requery the form to reflect the changes made by the SP
    Me.Requery
End Sub
Save the Current Record:

If Me.Dirty Then DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSaveRecord: This checks if there are unsaved changes on the form (using Me.Dirty) and saves them. 
acCmdSaveRecord is a command that commits those changes to the database.
Execute the Stored Procedure:

The SP is executed using a pass-through query. The connection string and SQL command are set, and then 
qdf.Execute runs the SP on the SQL Server.

Requery the Form:

Me.Requery: This line ensures the form is updated with the latest data after the SP has made changes to the database.
Considerations:
Handling Errors: It’s a good practice to wrap this in error handling to manage any issues that might arise during saving, 
executing the SP, or requerying.

Performance: Requerying reloads the entire form’s data, which might be performance-intensive if the dataset is large. 
If this is a concern, you might consider updating only the specific fields affected by the SP.

Summary:
By saving the record first, executing the stored procedure, and then requerying the form, you ensure that all changes are properly saved and reflected in the form, giving the user an accurate and up-to-date view of the data. This sequence should meet your needs effectively.
