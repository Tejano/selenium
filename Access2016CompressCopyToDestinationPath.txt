Yes, you can compress (compact) the Access database before copying it. In VBA, you can use 
the Application.CompactRepair method to compact and repair the database before performing the copy operation.
This method can be used to create a compacted version of the database file, which you can then copy.

Here's how you can modify the process:
1. Compress the Database Using CompactRepair
You can add a step to compact the database before copying it by using the Application.CompactRepair method.

Example Code to Compact and Copy the Database:

Public Sub CompactAndCopyDatabase(env As String)
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    Dim fso As Object
    Dim sourcePath As String
    Dim compactedPath As String
    Dim destinationPath As String
    Dim tempCompactedFile As String
    
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM EnvironmentTable WHERE environment = '" & env & "'")
    Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    If Not rs.EOF Then
        sourcePath = Application.CurrentDb.Name ' Path of the current database
        tempCompactedFile = fso.GetParentFolderName(sourcePath) & "\temp_compact.accdb" ' Temp file for compacted DB
        destinationPath = rs!destinationPath & rs!AccessName ' Destination Path
        
        ' Compact the current database
        If Application.CompactRepair(sourcePath, tempCompactedFile, True) Then
            ' After compacting, copy the compacted database
            If fso.FileExists(tempCompactedFile) Then
                fso.CopyFile tempCompactedFile, destinationPath, True
                MsgBox "Database compacted and copied to " & destinationPath
                ' Remove the temporary compacted file
                fso.DeleteFile tempCompactedFile
            Else
                MsgBox "Compacted database not found."
            End If
        Else
            MsgBox "Failed to compact the database."
        End If
    Else
        MsgBox "Environment not found."
    End If
    
    rs.Close
    Set rs = Nothing
    Set fso = Nothing
End Sub

How It Works:
Application.CompactRepair: This method is used to compact the current database (sourcePath) into a 
temporary file (tempCompactedFile).
Copy the Compacted Database: After compacting the database, the compacted version is copied to 
the destination path specified in your environment table.
Temporary Compacted File: After the copy is completed, the temporary compacted file is deleted.
2. Update the Button Click Event
You can update the btnCopyDatabase_Click event to call this new function.

Private Sub btnCopyDatabase_Click()
    ' Use the global variable to compact and copy the database for the current environment
    If Len(globalVariableEnv) > 0 Then
        Call CompactAndCopyDatabase(globalVariableEnv)
    Else
        MsgBox "Environment is not set."
    End If
End Sub

Final Notes:
This solution compacts the database to a temporary file before copying it to the final destination.
Make sure to handle any potential file locks or access issues that might occur during the compacting 
or copying process, especially if the database is being used actively.



Private Sub btnCopyDatabase_Click()
    Dim userResponse As VbMsgBoxResult
    
    ' Prompt the user to compact the database before copying
    userResponse = MsgBox("It's recommended to manually compact the database before copying. " & vbCrLf & _
                          "Would you like to stop now to manually compact?", vbYesNoCancel + vbExclamation, "Compact Database")

        Case vbNo
            ' User chose to continue without compacting, proceed with the copy
