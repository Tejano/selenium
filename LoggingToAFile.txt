In a Spring Boot project, you can configure the logging behavior, including directing log output to a text file, by adjusting the application's application.properties or application.yml configuration file.

Here's how you can do it using application.properties:

Create a log file:
Create a file where you want to store your logs, for example, application.log. Place it in a location where your Spring Boot application has write permissions.

Configure the logging in application.properties:
Open or create your src/main/resources/application.properties file and add the following lines:

logging.file.name=your-log-file-name.log

Replace your-log-file-name.log with the name you chose for your log file.

If you want to specify an absolute path, you can use:

logging.file.path=/absolute/path/to/your/logs

Spring Boot will automatically configure a RollingFileAppender to write logs to the specified file.

Adjust Log Level (Optional):
You can also set the logging level in the application.properties file:

logging.level.root=INFO

Replace INFO with the desired logging level (e.g., DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, etc.).

Run Your Application:
When you run your Spring Boot application, logs will be written to the specified file.

If you are using application.yml for configuration, the equivalent configuration would look like this:

logging:
  file:
    name: your-log-file-name.log
    path: /absolute/path/to/your/logs

logging.level:
  root: INFO

Remember that Spring Boot uses SLF4J for logging, so the underlying logging implementation will be 
based on the dependencies you have in your classpath. Common implementations include Logback and Log4j2. 
If you don't explicitly include any logging dependencies, Spring Boot will use its default logging (which is Logback).

Make sure to include the necessary dependencies in your pom.xml or build.gradle file if you want to use a specific logging framework.
