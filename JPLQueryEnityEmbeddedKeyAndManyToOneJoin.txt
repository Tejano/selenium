To create a query in the StandardReviewRepository for a DTO that contains a flat structure
 with livesYearMonth (part of the compound key), fields from StandardReviewEntity, and 
 some fields from AdjustmentEntity in a Spring Boot application, you can follow these steps:

Define the DTO: Create a DTO class that will contain
 the fields you need from both StandardReviewEntity and AdjustmentEntity. For example:
 
 public class StandardReviewDTO {
    private String livesYearMonth;
    // Additional fields from StandardReviewEntity
    // Fields from AdjustmentEntity
    // Getters and Setters
}

Modify the StandardReviewEntity: Ensure your StandardReviewEntity has 
the ManyToOne relationship to AdjustmentEntity and a compound key including livesYearMonth, adjustmentId, etc.
@Entity
public class StandardReviewEntity {
    @EmbeddedId
    private StandardReviewId id; // This includes livesYearMonth, adjustmentId, etc.

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "adjustmentId", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private AdjustmentEntity adjustment;
    // Other fields and methods
}
Create a Repository Query: In your StandardReviewRepository, you can use JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or
native SQL to create a query that joins StandardReviewEntity 
and AdjustmentEntity and selects the required fields. 
You can define this query method in the StandardReviewRepository interface.
@Repository
public interface StandardReviewRepository extends JpaRepository<StandardReviewEntity, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT new com.yourpackage.StandardReviewDTO(s.id.livesYearMonth, s.field1, s.field2, a.field1, a.field2) " +
           "FROM StandardReviewEntity s " +
           "JOIN s.adjustment a " +
           "WHERE s.id.livesYearMonth = :livesYearMonth")
    List<StandardReviewDTO> findDtoByLivesYearMonth(@Param("livesYearMonth") String livesYearMonth);
}
In the above query, replace field1, field2, etc., with the actual field names you want to include in your DTO.

Remember to adjust the field types and names according to your actual entity definitions and the fields you want to include 
in your DTO. The @Query annotation allows you to write a custom query for fetching the data as per your DTO structure.
