🚀 How to Compile & Build a Standalone .exe in VS Code Using .NET Core
Since you prefer VS Code over Visual Studio 2019, here’s how you can compile and generate an .exe using .NET Core / .NET 5+.

✅ Step 1: Install Required Tools
Check if .NET SDK is Installed
Open VS Code Terminal.
Run:
powershell

dotnet --version

If you see a version number, you’re good! ✅
If not, install the latest .NET SDK from Microsoft's .NET Download Page.
✅ Step 2: Set Up Your C# Project in VS Code
1️⃣ Open VS Code
Create a new folder for your project, e.g., ExcelConverter.
Open the folder in VS Code.
2️⃣ Create a New .NET Console Project
In VS Code Terminal, run:
powershell
dotnet new console -o ExcelConverter
This creates a C# console project inside the ExcelConverter folder.
Change to the project directory:
powershell

cd ExcelConverter
3️⃣ Install Required Dependencies
Run:

powershell

dotnet add package Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel
This installs Excel automation support.
✅ Step 3: Write Your C# Code
In VS Code, open Program.cs inside ExcelConverter.
Replace the existing code with your Excel processing script (the one that detects leading zeros & scientific notation).
✅ Step 4: Compile & Build .exe
Option 1: Compile for Your Own PC
Run:

powershell

dotnet build
This creates the .exe inside:

bin\Debug\netX\ExcelConverter.exe

Option 2: Compile a Standalone .exe for Any Windows PC
Run:
powershell

dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained true
This generates a standalone .exe that does NOT require .NET installed.
Find the .exe inside:

bin\Release\netX\win-x64\ExcelConverter.exe
✅ Step 5: Run the EXE
Navigate to your build folder:
powershell

cd bin\Release\netX\win-x64\
Run your new .exe:
powershell

.\ExcelConverter.exe

🔥 Recommended Extensions for VS Code
C# Dev Kit

Best for .NET development in VS Code
Install in VS Code:
Open Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X)
Search for "C# Dev Kit"
Click Install
.NET Install Tool for Extension Authors

Helps VS Code auto-detect .NET installations.
NuGet Package Manager

Makes it easier to install libraries like Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.
✅ Why This is Better Than Visual Studio 2019
✔ Faster & lightweight 💨
✔ Works directly in VS Code 🔥
✔ **Creates a standalone .exe users can run 💾

No, the C# Dev Kit is not necessary to compile and run C# projects in VS Code. You can still fully develop, compile, and build .exe files without signing in to Microsoft.

🚀 Do You Need C# Dev Kit?
❌ No, if you just want to compile and run C# → You can use .NET CLI (dotnet build, dotnet publish).
✅ Yes, if you want IntelliSense, debugging, and better VS Code integration.
✅ Alternative: Use C# Without Signing In
If you don’t want to sign in, you can install only the essentials:

1️⃣ Install the Official C# Extension (No Login Required)
Open VS Code → Press Ctrl + Shift + X (Extensions).
Search for "C#" (by Microsoft).
Install the C# extension (Omnisharp) instead of C# Dev Kit.
This lets you write, compile, and run C# in VS Code without needing a Microsoft login.

2️⃣ Compile & Run Without C# Dev Kit
You can do everything using the .NET CLI in VS Code’s terminal:

Compile the Project
powershell
dotnet build
Run the Project
powershell
Copy
Edit
dotnet run
Build a Standalone .exe
powershell

dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained true
This creates an .exe in bin\Release\netX\win-x64\ExcelConverter.exe.
🔥 Summary
✔ You don’t need C# Dev Kit to compile or run C# in VS Code.
✔ Install only the regular "C#" extension (Omnisharp) to get IntelliSense.
✔ Use dotnet build and dotnet publish to create .exe files.
