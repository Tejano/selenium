To include code in the Unload event of a temporary form that is created dynamically in VBA, 
you need to programmatically assign the event handler after creating the form. 
This can be done by setting the OnUnload property of the form to a VBA function or procedure that handles the Unload event.

Steps to Implement:
Create the Temporary Form:

Dynamically create the form using the CreateForm method.
Assign the Unload Event:

Set the OnUnload property of the form to point to a VBA procedure that will handle the formâ€™s unloading and deletion.
Create the Event Handler:

Define the event handler in a standard module so it can be referenced by the form.
Example Code:
Here's how you can create the form and assign an Unload event dynamically:

Step 1: Create the Temporary Form and Assign the Unload Event

Sub CreateTempFormWithUnloadEvent()
    Dim frm As Form
    Dim ctl As Control
    Dim frmName As String
    
    ' Create the temporary form
    Set frm = CreateForm
    frmName = frm.Name

    ' Set form properties
    frm.Caption = "Temporary Form"
    frm.RecordSource = "YourTableName" ' Set the record source if needed

    ' Add a control, like a text box
    Set ctl = CreateControl(frm.Name, acTextBox, , , "FieldName", 1000, 1000)

    ' Save the form with the specified name
    DoCmd.Save acForm, frm.Name

    ' Assign the Unload event to the form
    frm.OnUnload = "=DeleteTempForm('" & frmName & "')"

    ' Optionally close the form in design view
    DoCmd.Close acForm, frm.Name, acSaveYes
End Sub

Step 2: Create the Unload Event Handler in a Standard Module

Function DeleteTempForm(frmName As String)
    ' Automatically delete the form when it is closed
    On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Close the form first to ensure it's not in use
    DoCmd.Close acForm, frmName, acSaveNo

    ' Delete the form
    DoCmd.DeleteObject acForm, frmName
End Function

Explanation:
Creating the Form:

The form is created dynamically using CreateForm. The name of the form is captured in the variable frmName.
Assigning the Unload Event:

The OnUnload property of the form is set to point to a function DeleteTempForm. This function will be executed 
when the form is unloaded (closed). The syntax =DeleteTempForm('frmName') is used to pass the form
name as a parameter to the function.

Deleting the Form:

The DeleteTempForm function is defined in a standard module and deletes the form by using DoCmd.DeleteObject. 
This function is triggered when the form is closed.

Summary:
By dynamically assigning the Unload event handler to the temporary form after it is created, you can ensure that
the form is automatically deleted when it is closed. This approach keeps the form management self-contained
and ensures that temporary forms do not persist in the database beyond their intended use.
