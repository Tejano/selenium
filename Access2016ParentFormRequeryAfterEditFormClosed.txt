If you want to ensure that the parent form returns to the specific record that was updated in the edit form,
 you need to store the primary key (or unique identifier) of the record being updated and then, 
 after the Requery, reposition the parent form on that record.

Modify the Code to Return to the Updated Record:
Hereâ€™s an updated version of your btnClose_Click procedure that will reposition the parent form on
 the updated record after the Requery:
 Private Sub btnClose_Click()
    Dim recordID As Variant

    ' Capture the primary key of the current record in the edit form
    recordID = Me!YourPrimaryKeyFieldName ' Replace with the actual primary key field

    ' Refresh or Requery the parent form
    If CurrentProject.AllForms("ParentFormName").IsLoaded Then
        With Forms("ParentFormName")
            .Requery
            ' After requery, find the record with the same primary key
            .RecordsetClone.FindFirst "[YourPrimaryKeyFieldName] = " & recordID
            If Not .RecordsetClone.NoMatch Then
                ' Move to the found record
                .Bookmark = .RecordsetClone.Bookmark
            End If
        End With
    End If
    
    ' Close the edit form
    DoCmd.Close acForm, Me.Name
End Sub

 Explanation:
Capture the Primary Key:

Before closing the edit form, we capture the value of the record's primary key from the edit form (Me!YourPrimaryKeyFieldName). Replace YourPrimaryKeyFieldName with the actual name of your primary key field.
Requery the Parent Form:

After the Requery, we use the RecordsetClone of the parent form to search for the record with the same primary key (YourPrimaryKeyFieldName) as the one being edited.
Find and Set the Bookmark:

The .FindFirst method is used to locate the record in the parent form that matches the stored recordID.
If the record is found, the Bookmark property of the parent form is set to move to that record.

Handling Different Data Types:

If your primary key is a string, ensure the value is enclosed in single quotes:
Summary:
This updated version of the code ensures that after the Requery, the parent form navigates to the specific record that was updated in the edit form. This provides a seamless experience 
for the user, as they will be positioned on the same record they just edited.
