To effectively communicate to the business that not every part of the Access ADP app needs to be migrated and emphasize the importance of completing the micro-app for commgroups functionality, you can follow these steps:

1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation
Start by acknowledging the business's support and understanding of the migration mandate.

Example:
“We appreciate your support in helping us meet the enterprise migration mandate and your understanding of the complexities involved in this project.”

2. Explain the rationale clearly and concisely
Provide a clear and concise explanation of why not every part of the Access ADP app needs to be migrated.

Example:
“To efficiently meet the end-of-July migration mandate, we’ve identified that certain functionalities, specifically commgroups, are better suited for replacement by the micro-app we’re developing. This approach will save time and resources, ensuring a smoother transition.”

3. Highlight the benefits
Emphasize the benefits of focusing on the micro-app rather than migrating the entire ADP app.

Example:
“By prioritizing the completion of the micro-app, we can deliver a more robust and modern solution for the commgroups functionality. This not only meets the immediate migration requirements but also aligns with our long-term goal of enhancing our system capabilities.”

4. Address potential concerns
Acknowledge and address any potential concerns the business might have regarding this approach.

Example:
“We understand there might be concerns about the transition period. Rest assured, we have planned for minimal disruption and will provide comprehensive support to ensure a seamless experience for all users.”

5. Provide a timeline and action plan
Offer a clear timeline and action plan for the migration and the completion of the micro-app.

Example:
“Our plan is to finalize the micro-app by mid-July, which will allow us to fully integrate the commgroups functionality into the new system by the end of July. This ensures we meet the enterprise mandate on time while continuing to improve our systems.”

6. Invite feedback and collaboration
Encourage the business to share their thoughts and collaborate on the plan.

Example:
“We value your input and would like to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have. Your collaboration is crucial to the success of this project, and we are committed to working closely with you to achieve our goals.”

7. End with appreciation and confidence
Conclude by expressing confidence in the plan and appreciation for the business's cooperation.

Example:
“Thank you for your continued support and cooperation. We are confident that this approach will lead to a successful migration and a stronger, more efficient system. Together, we can achieve our goals and deliver exceptional results.”

By following these steps, you can effectively communicate the rationale and benefits of focusing on the micro-app, ensuring the business understands and supports the approach.
