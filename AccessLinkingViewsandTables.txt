Yes, views in SQL Server can be linked in Access just like tables. When you link a view in Access, it appears as a read-only table. You can query the view, but you cannot directly update its data through Access.

Updated Code to Handle Views
Let's update the code to handle both tables and views. We'll add a function to identify whether an object is a table or a view and link it accordingly.

1. Function to Check if Object is a Table or View
This function will use SQL Server's INFORMATION_SCHEMA to check whether the object is a table or a view.

Function GetObjectType(objectName As String, connString As String) As String
    Dim conn As ADODB.Connection
    Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
    Dim sql As String
    Dim objectType As String

    ' Create and open the connection
    Set conn = New ADODB.Connection
    conn.Open connString

    ' SQL to check the type of the object
    sql = "SELECT TABLE_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME = '" & objectName & "'"

    ' Execute the query
    Set rs = conn.Execute(sql)

    ' Get the object type
    If Not rs.EOF Then
        objectType = rs!TABLE_TYPE
    Else
        objectType = ""
    End If

    ' Clean up
    rs.Close
    conn.Close
    Set rs = Nothing
    Set conn = Nothing

    GetObjectType = objectType
End Function

2. Updated LinkTable Subroutine to Handle Views
This subroutine will use GetObjectType to determine if the object is a table or a view and then link it accordingly

Sub LinkTable(objectName As String, connString As String, logFilePath As String)
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
    Dim fileNum As Integer
    Dim sourceTableName As String
    Dim objectType As String

    ' Clean the object name to remove brackets and ensure schema
    sourceTableName = CleanTableName(objectName)

    ' Remove schema prefix for SourceTableName if present
    If InStr(sourceTableName, ".") > 0 Then
        sourceTableName = Split(sourceTableName, ".")(1)
    End If

    ' Determine if the object is a table or a view
    objectType = GetObjectType(sourceTableName, connString)

    If objectType = "BASE TABLE" Or objectType = "VIEW" Then
        Set db = CurrentDb()
        
        ' Delete existing table link if it exists
        On Error Resume Next
        db.TableDefs.Delete sourceTableName
        On Error GoTo 0

        ' Create new table link
        On Error GoTo LinkError
        Set tdf = db.CreateTableDef(sourceTableName)
        tdf.Connect = connString
        tdf.SourceTableName = objectName ' Use original objectName with schema for the connection
        db.TableDefs.Append tdf
        Exit Sub

    LinkError:
        ' Log the error to the file
        fileNum = FreeFile
        Open logFilePath For Append As #fileNum
        Print #fileNum, "Failed to link object: " & objectName & " - Error Number: " & Err.Number & " - Description: " & Err.Description
        Close #fileNum
        Err.Clear
    Else
        ' Log that the object type was not a table or view
        fileNum = FreeFile
        Open logFilePath For Append As #fileNum
        Print #fileNum, "Object: " & objectName & " is not a table or view"
        Close #fileNum
    End If
End Sub

3. Updated Functions to Link Tables and Views
Link Tables and Views from Queries

Function LinkTablesFromQueries(connString As String, logFilePath As String) As Collection
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim colTables As New Collection
    Dim strSQL As String
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim tableNames As Variant
    Dim i As Integer

    Set db = CurrentDb()

    ' Loop through all queries
    For Each qdf In db.QueryDefs
        strSQL = qdf.SQL
        tableNames = ExtractTableNamesFromSQL(strSQL)
        ' Ensure tableNames is an array before looping
        If IsArray(tableNames) Then
            For i = LBound(tableNames) To UBound(tableNames)
                If Len(tableNames(i)) > 0 Then ' Ensure the table name is not empty
                    tableName = CleanTableName(CStr(tableNames(i)))
                    On Error Resume Next
                    colTables.Add tableName, tableName ' Avoid duplicates
                    On Error GoTo 0
                    LinkTable tableName, connString, logFilePath ' Link the table or view
                End If
            Next i
        End If
    Next qdf

    Set LinkTablesFromQueries = colTables
End Function

        DoCmd.OpenForm obj.Name, acDesign
        Set frm = Forms(obj.Name)
        strSQL = frm.RecordSource
        If Len(strSQL) > 0 Then
            tableNames = ExtractTableNamesFromSQL(strSQL)
            ' Ensure tableNames is an array before looping
            If IsArray(tableNames) Then
                For i = LBound(tableNames) To UBound(tableNames)
                    If Len(tableNames(i)) > 0 Then ' Ensure the table name is not empty
                        tableName = CleanTableName(CStr(tableNames(i)))
                        On Error Resume Next
                        colTables.Add tableName, tableName ' Avoid duplicates
                        On Error GoTo 0
                        LinkTable tableName, connString, logFilePath ' Link the table or view
                    End If
                Next i
            End If
        End If
        For Each ctl In frm.Controls
            If ctl.ControlType = acComboBox Or ctl.ControlType = acListBox Then
                strSQL = ctl.RowSource
                If Len(strSQL) > 0 Then
                    tableNames = ExtractTableNamesFromSQL(strSQL)
                    ' Ensure tableNames is an array before looping
                    If IsArray(tableNames) Then
                        For i = LBound(tableNames) To UBound(tableNames)
                            If Len(tableNames(i)) > 0 Then ' Ensure the table name is not empty
                                tableName = CleanTableName(CStr(tableNames(i)))
                                On Error Resume Next
                                colTables.Add tableName, tableName ' Avoid duplicates

                        Next i
                    End If
                End If
            End If
        Next ctl
        DoCmd.Close acForm, obj.Name, acSaveYes
    Next obj

            ' Ensure tableNames is an array before looping
            If IsArray(tableNames) Then
                For i = LBound(tableNames) To UBound(tableNames)
                    If Len(tableNames(i)) > 0 Then ' Ensure the table name is not empty

        DoCmd.Close acReport, obj.Name, acSaveYes
    Next obj

    Set LinkTablesFromFormsReports = colTables
End Function

4. Main Subroutine to Link Used Tables and Views

Sub LinkUsedTables()
    Dim colTables As Collection
    Dim tbl As Variant
    Dim connString As String
    Dim logFilePath As String

    ' Use the appropriate ODBC driver with Windows Authentication
    connString = "ODBC;Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=YourServerName;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"
    logFilePath = "C:\ExportedObjects\LinkErrors.log"

    ' Create or clear the log file
    Open logFilePath For Output As #1
    Print #1, "Log started at " & Now
    Close #1

    ' Get table names from queries, forms, and reports and link them
    Set colTables = New Collection
    For Each tbl In LinkTablesFromQueries(connString, logFilePath)
        On Error Resume Next
        colTables.Add tbl, tbl ' Avoid duplicates
        On Error GoTo 0
    Next tbl
    For Each tbl In LinkTablesFromFormsReports(connString, logFilePath)
        On Error Resume Next
        colTables.Add tbl, tbl ' Avoid duplicates
        On Error GoTo 0
    Next tbl

    MsgBox "Linking process completed! Check " & logFilePath & " for any errors."
End Sub
Explanation
GetObjectType Function:

Checks if the object is a table or view using SQL Server's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
LinkTable Subroutine:

Uses GetObjectType to determine if the object is a table or view before linking.
Logs any errors encountered during the linking process.
Functions to Link Tables and Views from Queries and Forms/Reports:

Extracts object names and calls the LinkTable subroutine with the cleaned object names.
Main Subroutine to Link Used Tables and Views:

Initializes logging and processes the linking of tables and views, ensuring proper handling of object names.
Steps to Execute
Run TestSQLServerConnection to ensure the connection string works and SQL Server is reachable.
Run LinkUsedTables to attempt to link the tables and views and log any errors.
Review LinkErrors.log for detailed error messages and correct any issues with object names or connection parameters.
Run LogLinkedTables to verify which tables and views, if any, were successfully linked.
By following these steps and using the updated code, you can handle linking both tables and views in Access, ensuring they are linked correctly and logging any errors encountered during the process.
