Here’s a method to track such changes and include them in your email:

1. Manual Change Tracking Table:
Create a table to manually log significant changes made to the Access database.

sql

CREATE TABLE ChangeLog (
    ChangeID AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ChangeType TEXT(255),         ' E.g., Form, Query, Module, etc.
    ObjectName TEXT(255),         ' The name of the object modified
    ChangeDescription MEMO,       ' Description of the modification
    ModifiedBy TEXT(50),          ' User who made the change
    ChangeDate DATETIME           ' Date and time of the modification
);
CREATE TABLE ChangeLog (
    ChangeID AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    VersionID LONG,               -- Foreign key linking to the Version in the Environment table
    ChangeDescription MEMO,       -- Description of the change
    ChangeType TEXT(255),         -- Type of change (Form, Report, Module, Query, etc.)
    ObjectName TEXT(255),         -- Name of the object modified
    ModifiedBy TEXT(50),          -- User who made the change
    ChangeDate DATETIME,          -- Date and time of the change
    CONSTRAINT FK_VersionID FOREIGN KEY (VersionID) REFERENCES Environment(Version)
);


You can manually log significant changes to forms, modules, or other objects in this table. 
For example, when you update a form, you can add an entry describing the update.




To implement the process you've described, where the database move notification email includes change logs only if the database has been updated, and the ChangeLog email flag is reset to False after sending, you can modify the CopyDatabase() function accordingly.

1. Process Overview:
When the database is moved and there are changes, an email is sent with both the move notification and the change log.
After the email is sent, the SendChangeLogFlag is reset to False in the Environment table.
For subsequent moves (when no changes were made), only the standard move email is sent.
2. Updated CopyDatabase() Code:

Sub CopyDatabase()
    Dim dbPath As String
    Dim destPath As String
    Dim dbName As String
    Dim emailFlag As Boolean
    Dim changeLogFlag As Boolean
    Dim versionID As Long
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim recipients As String
    Dim copySuccess As Boolean
    Dim emailSubject As String
    Dim emailBody As String
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim sqlStr As String

    ' Assuming the fields "AccessName", "Path", "EmailFlag", "SendChangeLogFlag", "Version", "Recipients", and "TableName" are in your table
    dbName = DLookup("AccessName", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust ID and table as needed
    destPath = DLookup("Path", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Path field from your table
    emailFlag = DLookup("EmailFlag", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Email flag from your table
    changeLogFlag = DLookup("SendChangeLogFlag", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' New flag for sending the change log
    versionID = DLookup("Version", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Get the current version
    tableName = DLookup("TableName", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust as needed
    recipients = DLookup("Recipients", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust as needed

    dbPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Database\" & dbName ' Adjust the source path
    destPath = destPath & "\" & dbName ' Combine with the destination path

    ' Assuming you have code to check if the db is being used, something like this:
    If IsDatabaseInUse(dbPath) Then
        MsgBox "Database is in use and cannot be copied.", vbExclamation
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Try to copy the database
    On Error Resume Next
    FileCopy dbPath, destPath
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        copySuccess = True
        MsgBox "Database copied successfully.", vbInformation
    Else
        copySuccess = False
        MsgBox "Failed to copy the database: " & Err.Description, vbExclamation
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0

    ' If the copy was successful, check whether to send the changelog email
    If copySuccess Then
        If changeLogFlag Then
            ' Send email with change log and move details
            emailSubject = "New Database Moved - " & tableName & " (Version: " & versionID & ")"
            emailBody = "A new version of the database (" & dbName & ") has been moved to the following location: " & vbCrLf & _
                        destPath & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "Here are the changes for this version:" & vbCrLf

            ' Append the change log to the email body
            emailBody = emailBody & GetChangeLog(versionID)

            ' Send the email with the changelog
            Call SendGenericEmail(recipients, emailSubject, emailBody)

            ' Reset the SendChangeLogFlag to False after the email is sent
            Set db = CurrentDb
            sqlStr = "UPDATE YourTable SET SendChangeLogFlag = False WHERE ID = 1"
            db.Execute sqlStr
            Set db = Nothing
        Else
            ' Send the standard move email (no changes)
            emailSubject = "Database Moved - " & tableName
            emailBody = "The database (" & dbName & ") has been moved to the following location: " & vbCrLf & destPath

            ' Send the standard move email
            Call SendGenericEmail(recipients, emailSubject, emailBody)
        End If
    End If
End Sub

Supporting Function: GetChangeLog
This function retrieves the change log entries for the specific version and returns them as a string.

Function GetChangeLog(versionID As Long) As String
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim rs As DAO.Recordset
    Dim changeLog As String

    ' Open the ChangeLog table and get changes for the specified version
    Set db = CurrentDb
    Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM ChangeLog WHERE VersionID = " & versionID)

    ' Construct the change log string
    changeLog = ""
    Do While Not rs.EOF
        changeLog = changeLog & "Change Type: " & rs!ChangeType & vbCrLf & _
                              "Object Name: " & rs!ObjectName & vbCrLf & _
                              "Description: " & rs!ChangeDescription & vbCrLf & _
                              "Modified By: " & rs!ModifiedBy & vbCrLf & _
                              "Change Date: " & rs!ChangeDate & vbCrLf & vbCrLf
        rs.MoveNext
    Loop

    ' Close the recordset
    rs.Close
    Set rs = Nothing
    Set db = Nothing

    ' Return the change log
    GetChangeLog = changeLog
End Function

Key Adjustments:
SendChangeLogFlag Logic: If the SendChangeLogFlag is set to True, the email includes the change log, and the flag is reset to False after sending the email.
Standard Move Email: If there are no changes (i.e., SendChangeLogFlag is False), only the standard database move email is sent.
GetChangeLog Function: Retrieves the change log for the specified version and formats it for inclusion in the email.
Flow of Events:
Database Copy: The CopyDatabase() function copies the database to the new path.
ChangeLog Email: If the SendChangeLogFlag is True, the change log is included in the email, and the flag is reset to False.
Standard Move Email: If there are no new changes, a simple move notification email is sent.
Flag Reset: After sending the change log email, the SendChangeLogFlag is set to False so future moves don’t resend the same changes.
This process ensures that users are informed of both the database move and any changes that occurred, while preventing duplicate change log notifications if the database is moved again without further updates.
