To address the issue of stored procedures (SPs) referencing the RowVersion column indirectly (e.g., via SELECT *), and ensure the SPs use all the columns explicitly, you can take the following steps:

1. Identify Stored Procedures Referencing the Table
Start by identifying all stored procedures that reference the affected table. Use the system views in SQL Server to find SPs that mention the table:



SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_NAME(sm.object_id) AS ProcedureName
FROM sys.sql_modules sm
WHERE sm.definition LIKE '%YourTableName%'
  AND sm.definition NOT LIKE '%RowVersion%'; -- Check if RowVersion is explicitly referenced

Replace YourTableName with the name of the table.
This query finds stored procedures where RowVersion might not be explicitly referenced.

2. Check for SELECT * in Stored Procedures
Find SPs that use SELECT * in their queries. This is a common source of issues when schema changes occur:

SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_NAME(sm.object_id) AS ProcedureName
FROM sys.sql_modules sm
WHERE sm.definition LIKE 'SELECT *%'
  AND sm.definition LIKE '%YourTableName%';
This identifies stored procedures that query all columns (SELECT *) from the table.

SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_NAME(sm.object_id) AS ProcedureName
FROM sys.sql_modules sm
WHERE sm.definition COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS LIKE '%SELECT%'
  AND sm.definition COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS LIKE '%YourTableName%'
  OR sm.definition COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS LIKE '%dbo.YourTableName%';



3. Extract and Inspect SP Definitions
For each stored procedure identified, retrieve its full definition to check for SELECT * or implicit column references:

SELECT OBJECT_NAME(object_id) AS ProcedureName, definition
FROM sys.sql_modules
WHERE OBJECT_NAME(object_id) = 'YourStoredProcedureName'; -- Replace with SP name

4. Automate Detection of Missing Columns
To automate the detection of missing columns in SPs:

Get the Table's Schema: Retrieve the current column list for the table:
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'YourTableName';

Compare the Column List Against SP Definitions: Use this query to check if all table columns are referenced in the SPs:

SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_NAME(sm.object_id) AS ProcedureName
FROM sys.sql_modules sm
WHERE sm.definition LIKE '%YourTableName%'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS c
      WHERE c.TABLE_NAME = 'YourTableName'
        AND sm.definition LIKE '%' + c.COLUMN_NAME + '%'
  );
