✅ Step 1: Run .exe in CMD with Debugging
Since double-clicking doesn’t show errors, run it in CMD and capture any issues:

powershell

convertwithnomip.exe > log.txt 2>&1
Then open log.txt and check for errors.

If nothing prints, try running it in CMD without redirecting output:

powershell

convertwithnomip.exe
Do you see any error messages? If so, send them here.

✅ Step 2: Rebuild .exe with Hidden Imports
Some modules (like pandas and openpyxl) might not be included correctly in the .exe. Rebuild it with:

powershell

pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import pandas --hidden-import openpyxl --hidden-import win32com.client convertwithnomip.py
Then, run the new .exe and see if it works.

✅ Step 3: Try Without --onefile
Sometimes, --onefile causes issues when dependencies are loaded dynamically. Try:

powershell

pyinstaller convertwithnomip.py
This will generate a dist/convertwithnomip/ folder with multiple files.
Now, run the .exe inside that folder:

powershell

cd dist/convertwithnomip
convertwithnomip.exe
Does it work now?
✔ Yes? → The issue was with --onefile.
✔ No? → Move to Step 4.

✅ Step 4: Rebuild With Debug Mode
Rebuild the .exe with console output enabled, so errors aren’t hidden:

powershell
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --onefile --debug=all convertwithnomip.py
Now run the .exe from CMD and see if an error message appears.

✅ Step 5: Use print() Statements to Find Where It Hangs
If the .exe still hangs, edit convertwithnomip.py to print debugging info:

python

print("🚀 Script started...")  

try:
    print("🔍 Checking paths...")
    print(f"📂 Source Folder: {source_folder}")
    print(f"📂 Destination Folder: {dest_folder}")

    print("📄 Running process_xls_files()...")
    process_xls_files()
    
    print("✅ All files processed successfully!")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ ERROR: {e}")
Rebuild the .exe and check which message prints last.

🔥 Summary
✔ Run the .exe in CMD to capture errors (convertwithnomip.exe > log.txt 2>&1).
✔ Rebuild with --hidden-import pandas --hidden-import openpyxl --hidden-import win32com.client.
✔ Try without --onefile to see if dependencies are the issue.
✔ Rebuild with --debug=all to force error messages to appear.
✔ Add print() statements to find where it hangs.
