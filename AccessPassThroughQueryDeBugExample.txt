Unfortunately, debug statements like PRINT or RAISERROR in SQL Server are not directly visible in Access when running a pass-through query. Access does not capture messages sent to the client by SQL Server—only the result set or errors that terminate execution.

To view debug output from your pass-through query in Access, you’ll need to handle it differently. Here are some approaches:

1. Capture Debug Output in a Result Set
Instead of using PRINT or RAISERROR, return debug messages as part of a result set using a SELECT statement. Access will capture and display this output.



DECLARE @start_month INT = 1;
DECLARE @end_month INT = 6;
DECLARE @cutover INT;

-- Return debug info as part of result sets
SELECT 'Debug: Parameters' AS DebugInfo, @start_month AS StartMonth, @end_month AS EndMonth;

-- Simulate calculation for @cutover
SELECT @cutover = MAX(SomeColumn)
FROM SourceTable
WHERE Month BETWEEN @start_month AND @end_month;

-- Return debug info for @cutover
SELECT 'Debug: Cutover Value' AS DebugInfo, @cutover AS Cutover;

-- Main query logic
IF @cutover IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    CREATE TABLE #TempTable (ID INT, Value NVARCHAR(50), Month INT, Cutover INT);

    INSERT INTO #TempTable (ID, Value, Month, Cutover)
    SELECT ID, Value, Month, @cutover
    FROM SourceTable
    WHERE Month BETWEEN @start_month AND @end_month;

    -- Debug: Return inserted rows
    SELECT 'Debug: TempTable Records' AS DebugInfo, * FROM #TempTable;

    -- Final output
    SELECT * FROM #TempTable;

    DROP TABLE #TempTable;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    SELECT 'Error: No data found to calculate @cutover' AS DebugInfo;
END;
