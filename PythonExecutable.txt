To package the script as a standalone .exe, I'll use PyInstaller to bundle everything needed so that the user doesn't have to install Python or any dependencies.

Steps to Package the .exe
Convert the Python script into an executable using PyInstaller.
Ensure it runs as a standalone file without requiring Python on the user's machine.
Provide the final .exe file for you to test.
I'll now generate the .exe and share it with you.

It looks like PyInstaller is not available in this environment. However, you can easily create the standalone .exe on your own machine using the following steps:

Steps to Build the .exe on Your Windows Machine
Install Python (if not installed):

Download and install Python from python.org.
Ensure you select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
Install PyInstaller:
Open Command Prompt and run:
pip install pyinstaller

Save the Script:

Copy the Python script from my response.
Save it as update_mip_labels.py in a folder (e.g., C:\Scripts).
Build the .exe:
Navigate to the scriptâ€™s folder in Command Prompt:

cd C:\Scripts

Run PyInstaller to create a standalone .exe:

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole update_mip_labels.py

The --onefile flag bundles everything into a single .exe.
The --noconsole flag prevents a console window from appearing.
Find the .exe:
The executable will be created in:

C:\Scripts\dist\update_mip_labels.exe
You can now move this .exe file to any Windows machine, and it will run without needing Python installed.









Minimal User Rights to Run the .exe
Standard User Account

The .exe can be executed by a standard user without admin rights, as long as the script does not require elevated privileges (e.g., modifying system files).
It should be placed in a directory where the user has read & execute permissions (e.g., C:\Users\Username\Documents).
Write Permissions to Destination Folder

The user must have write access to the destination folder where files will be moved.
PowerShell Execution Policy

By default, standard users may not be allowed to run PowerShell scripts if execution policies are restricted.
1)To check the current execution policy, run this in PowerShell:
Get-ExecutionPolicy

2)If the policy is too restrictive, the user may need to temporarily bypass it by modifying the script to execute PowerShell in bypass mode:
powershell_cmd = f'''
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Set-Label -File '{source_path}' -LabelId '{label_id}'"
'''
subprocess.run(["powershell", "-Command", powershell_cmd], shell=True)

3)If admin approval is needed, an administrator can set the policy to allow signed scripts:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser


Admin Rights Required?
âœ… No Admin Rights Required if:

The user has write access to the source and destination folders.
PowerShell Execution Policy is set to allow script execution.
The Set-Label PowerShell command does not require admin privileges.
ðŸš¨ Admin Rights May Be Required if:

The execution policy is too restrictive (e.g., Restricted or AllSigned).
The MIP Labeling feature enforces administrative permissions.
