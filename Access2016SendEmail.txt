Splitting the process into two separate subs, one for copying the database and another for sending the email, 
makes sense given your need to add an email flag. Here's how you can structure the two subs and ensure that the email is only sent if the copy is successful and the flag is set:

Example Code
Sub for Copying the Database
This sub will handle copying the database and checking if the email flag is set. If it is, it will call the email sub.

Sub CopyDatabase()
    Dim dbPath As String
    Dim destPath As String
    Dim dbName As String
    Dim emailFlag As Boolean
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim recipients As String
    Dim copySuccess As Boolean

    ' Assuming the fields "AccessName", "Path", "EmailFlag", "Recipients", and "TableName" are in your table
    dbName = DLookup("AccessName", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust ID and table as needed
    destPath = DLookup("Path", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Path field from your table
    emailFlag = DLookup("EmailFlag", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Email flag from your table

    dbPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Database\" & dbName ' Adjust the source path
    destPath = destPath & "\" & dbName ' Combine with the destination path

    ' Assuming you have code to check if the db is being used, something like this:
    If IsDatabaseInUse(dbPath) Then
        MsgBox "Database is in use and cannot be copied.", vbExclamation
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Try to copy the database
    On Error Resume Next
    FileCopy dbPath, destPath
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        copySuccess = True
        MsgBox "Database copied successfully.", vbInformation
    Else
        copySuccess = False
        MsgBox "Failed to copy the database: " & Err.Description, vbExclamation
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0

    ' If the copy was successful and the email flag is set, call the SendEmail sub
    If copySuccess And emailFlag Then
        Call SendEmail(destPath, dbName)
    End If
End Sub

' Function to check if the database is in use (you need to implement this)
Function IsDatabaseInUse(dbPath As String) As Boolean
    ' Placeholder logic, implement your own check
    IsDatabaseInUse = False
End Function

Sub for Sending the Email
This sub handles the actual email sending. It receives the destination path and the database name as parameters.
Sub SendEmail(destPath As String, dbName As String)
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim recipients As String
    Dim outlookApp As Object
    Dim mailItem As Object
    Dim bodyMessage As String

    ' Get additional fields from the table (you may need to adjust the table and ID)
    tableName = DLookup("TableName", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust as needed
    recipients = DLookup("Recipients", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust as needed

    ' Create the Outlook Application
    Set outlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set mailItem = outlookApp.CreateItem(0) ' Create a new email item

    ' Set the body of the email
    bodyMessage = "A new version of the database (" & dbName & ") has been moved to the following location: " & vbCrLf & _
                  destPath & vbCrLf & "Please use this updated version."

    ' Configure the email
    With mailItem
        .Subject = "New Database Moved - " & tableName ' Include table name in the subject
        .Body = bodyMessage
        .To = recipients ' Use recipients from the table
        .Send ' Send the email
    End With

    MsgBox "Email sent to users.", vbInformation

    ' Clean up
    Set mailItem = Nothing
    Set outlookApp = Nothing
End Sub

Key Points:
CopyDatabase Sub: This sub handles the copy operation and checks if the database is in use. 
If the copy is successful and the email flag is set, it calls SendEmail.
SendEmail Sub: This sub sends the email notification. It receives the destPath and
 dbName as parameters to customize the email message.
IsDatabaseInUse Function: This is a placeholder function where you can implement your logic
 to check if the database is in use.
This structure gives you flexibility, as you can easily control whether an email is sent based on the flag in your table,
 and it cleanly separates the logic for copying and emailing.

To make the email sub/function more generic and reusable across other parts of your Access application, 
you can modify it to accept parameters for the subject, recipients, and body. This will allow you to call the 
sub from different functions or parts of your Access application while passing in the necessary values dynamically.

Hereâ€™s how you can create a generic email function:

Generic Email Function
 
 Sub SendGenericEmail(recipients As String, subject As String, bodyMessage As String)
    Dim outlookApp As Object
    Dim mailItem As Object
    
    ' Create the Outlook Application
    Set outlookApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set mailItem = outlookApp.CreateItem(0) ' Create a new email item

    ' Configure the email
    With mailItem
        .Subject = subject ' Set the email subject dynamically
        .Body = bodyMessage ' Set the body message dynamically
        .To = recipients ' Set recipients dynamically
        .Send ' Send the email
    End With

    MsgBox "Email sent successfully.", vbInformation

    ' Clean up
    Set mailItem = Nothing
    Set outlookApp = Nothing
End Sub

Example of Using the Generic Function in Your Database Copy Process
You can now modify your CopyDatabase sub to use the generic email function like this:

Sub CopyDatabase()
    Dim dbPath As String
    Dim destPath As String
    Dim dbName As String
    Dim emailFlag As Boolean
    Dim tableName As String
    Dim recipients As String
    Dim copySuccess As Boolean
    Dim emailSubject As String
    Dim emailBody As String

    ' Assuming the fields "AccessName", "Path", "EmailFlag", "Recipients", and "TableName" are in your table
    dbName = DLookup("AccessName", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust ID and table as needed
    destPath = DLookup("Path", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Path field from your table
    emailFlag = DLookup("EmailFlag", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Email flag from your table
    tableName = DLookup("TableName", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust as needed
    recipients = DLookup("Recipients", "YourTable", "ID = 1") ' Adjust as needed

    dbPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Database\" & dbName ' Adjust the source path
    destPath = destPath & "\" & dbName ' Combine with the destination path

    ' Assuming you have code to check if the db is being used, something like this:
    If IsDatabaseInUse(dbPath) Then
        MsgBox "Database is in use and cannot be copied.", vbExclamation
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Try to copy the database
    On Error Resume Next
    FileCopy dbPath, destPath
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        copySuccess = True
        MsgBox "Database copied successfully.", vbInformation
    Else
        copySuccess = False
        MsgBox "Failed to copy the database: " & Err.Description, vbExclamation
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0

    ' If the copy was successful and the email flag is set, prepare and send the email
    If copySuccess And emailFlag Then
        emailSubject = "New Database Moved - " & tableName ' Dynamic subject
        emailBody = "A new version of the database (" & dbName & ") has been moved to the following location: " & vbCrLf & _
                    destPath & vbCrLf & "Please use this updated version."

        ' Call the generic email function
        Call SendGenericEmail(recipients, emailSubject, emailBody)
    End If
End Sub
