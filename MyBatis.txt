MyBatis Generator:
MyBatis Generator (MBG) is a tool that can generate Java classes, XML mapper files, and other artifacts from an existing database schema. While it is often associated with the MyBatis SQL mapping framework, it can be used to generate standalone entity classes as well. It's a command-line tool, and you can configure it to generate entity classes based on your SQL Server schema.

To use MyBatis Generator:

Add Dependencies:
You will need to add the MyBatis Generator Maven plugin to your project's pom.xml file.

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mybatis.generator</groupId>
            <artifactId>mybatis-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version><!-- Specify the version --></version>
            <configuration>
                <!-- Configuration options -->
            </configuration>
            <dependencies>
                <!-- Add database-specific dependencies (SQL Server JDBC driver) -->
            </dependencies>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

Configure the Generator:
Create a MyBatis Generator configuration file (e.g., generatorConfig.xml) where you define how the classes should be generated based on your SQL Server schema. In this configuration, you'll specify database connection details, tables to generate entities for, and how the entities should be generated.

Run the Generator:
Execute the MyBatis Generator plugin using the Maven command: mvn mybatis-generator:generate

Integrate Generated Classes:
Once the classes are generated, you can integrate them into your Spring Boot project as regular Java classes. These classes won't be managed by JPA or Hibernate, so you'll need to manually handle database operations if necessary.

Remember that MyBatis Generator is not an ORM framework like Hibernate; it's a code generation tool. While it can help you quickly generate entity classes, the generated classes won't have the same level of integration as JPA-managed entities.

Always refer to the official documentation and resources for the latest and most accurate instructions on how to set up and use MyBatis Generator effectively.


To generate an entity class for a specific table using the MyBatis Generator Maven plugin, 
you can use the <table> element in the plugin's configuration and provide the <tableName> 
and <domainObjectName> options as you've shown. Here's the relevant part of your configuration:


<plugin>
    <groupId>org.mybatis.generator</groupId>
    <artifactId>mybatis-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version><!-- Use the latest version available --></version>
    <configuration>
        <!-- Other configuration options -->

        <!-- Table Configuration -->
        <table>
            <tableName>BrokerCalcuationClaims</tableName>
            <!-- Specify the name of the table to generate an entity for -->
            <domainObjectName>BCC</domainObjectName>
            <!-- Specify the desired name for the generated entity class -->
        </table>
    </configuration>
</plugin>

In this example, the plugin will generate an entity class for the table named "BrokerCalcuationClaims" 
and name the generated entity class "BCC". The generated class will have JPA annotations and methods based on the columns and structure of the specified table.

Remember that you can have multiple <table> elements within the configuration to generate entity classes for multiple tables. 
Each <table> element defines how the entity class should be generated for a specific table.

After configuring the plugin in your pom.xml file, run the command mvn mybatis-generator:generate to trigger the code generation process based on your configuration. The generated entity class will be placed in the specified output directory or package structure.

As always, ensure that your configuration aligns with the specific version of the MyBatis Generator plugin you're using 
and refer to the official documentation for accurate and detailed information.
